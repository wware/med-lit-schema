The lack of these molecular targets, combined with the limitations of current treatment, particularly chemotherapy, which suffers from poor tumor selectivity, systemic toxicity, rapid development of resistance, and high recurrence rates, underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticle-based therapies have emerged as promising alternatives to overcome these challenges. Bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNps), in particular, are recognized for their biocompatibility and multifunctional biological activity, yet their anticancer potential against TNBC remains fully unexplored. This study therefore aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and molecular mechanisms of BGNps in highly aggressive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cells were treated with two-fold increasing concentrations of BGNps (7.8&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;g/ml), and cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay. Genomic DNA integrity was evaluated using the alkaline comet assay, while oxidative stress and mitochondrial function were measured with 2&#8242;,7&#8242;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (2&#8242;,7&#8242;-DCFH-DA) and Rhodamine-123 staining, respectively. Apoptotic induction was further examined using DAPI nuclear staining and chromatin diffusion assays, and transcriptional regulation of apoptosis- and mitochondria-related genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results of MTT assay demonstrated that BGNps exerted potent, concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells, with an IC50 value of 184.3&#160;&#181;g/ml. Treatment with BGNps at the IC50 concentration induced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, severe mitochondrial membrane depolarization, extensive genomic DNA damage, and pronounced apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. These effects were associated with marked upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> and concurrent downregulation of anti-apoptotic <italic toggle="yes">Bcl-2</italic> and mitochondrial <italic toggle="yes">ND3</italic> genes, amplifying oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, BGNps display strong potential as a novel nanotherapeutic for TNBC, offering an effective alternative to conventional chemotherapy. Their multi-step mechanism; encompassing ROS induction, mitochondrial disruption, and apoptosis activation, highlights their promise in overcoming the intrinsic resistance and therapeutic limitations of this highly aggressive breast cancer subtype.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BGNps</kwd><kwd>TNBC</kwd><kwd>MDA-MB-231 cancer cells</kwd><kwd>Cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Genomic DNA integrity</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial deplorization and apoptosis induction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biochemistry</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Drug discovery</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Cairo University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and clinically challenging subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. This phenotype deprives TNBC patients of the therapeutic benefits offered by endocrine or HER2-targeted therapies, which are effective in other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC accounts for approximately 15&#8211;20% of all breast cancer cases worldwide and the global incidence of TNBC has been steadily rising, with disproportionately more prevalent among younger women, African-American populations, and individuals with BRCA1 mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite its relatively lower incidence compared to other subtypes, TNBC is associated with a significantly higher risk of high proliferation rate, early metastasisspread, particularly to visceral organs and the brain, recurrence, and poor prognosis due to the lack of targeted therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Despite advances in oncology, systemic chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for TNBC due to the lack of specific molecular targets. Standard regimens typically include anthracyclines, taxanes, and platinum-based drugs. However, clinical outcomes remain unsatisfactory, especially in patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease, where survival rates are markedly lower and disease progression is often rapid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Chemotherapy is further limited by poor tumor selectivity, systemic toxicity, and cumulative side effects such as cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, and neurotoxicity, which compromise both treatment adherence and patient quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, chemotherapy-induced genotoxic stress frequently leads to the development of chemoresistance, tumor recurrence, and long-term damage to healthy tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These multifaceted challenges clearly highlight the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies that are safer, more selective, and mechanistically distinct from conventional chemotherapeutic agents that can selectively target TNBC and overcome chemoresistance while minimizing harm to healthy tissues.</p><p id="Par6">Recent developments in nanotechnology offer promising strategies for enhancing cancer therapy through improved drug delivery, selective cytotoxicity, and controlled cellular interactions. Among these, bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNps) have emerged as a novel class of inorganic nanomaterials with potential biomedical applications beyond bone regeneration due to their unique physicochemical properties, including high biocompatibility, controlled biodegradability, and ion-releasing capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. BGNps are composed primarily of silicon, calcium, sodium and phosphorus oxides, and upon degradation in biological fluid, they release these therapeutic ions that can interact with cellular environments to modulate biological responses such as proliferation, mitochondrial function, apoptosis, and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These properties suggest that BGNps may function not only as delivery vehicles, but also as standalone cytotoxic agents capable of disrupting tumor cell viability through non-drug-mediated mechanisms.</p><p id="Par7">Although the regenerative utilities of BGNps in bone repair and tissue engineering are well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, their therapeutic potential in oncology, particularly in TNBC, remains fully unexplored. Emerging evidence suggests that bioactive glass particles exhibit selective cytotoxicity against certain malignancies, such as osteosarcoma and glioblastoma, primarily through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of genomic instability, and activation of apoptotic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, these studies have utilized bulk or microparticulate forms of bioactive glass, which differ significantly from nanoparticles in terms of surface area-to-volume ratio, ion release kinetics, and cellular uptake behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The biological interactions of BGNps with cancer cells, particularly their impact on mitochondrial membrane integrity, DNA stability, and ROS-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms in breast cancer cells, remain poorly characterized, especially within the context of TNBC, which is known for its aggressive phenotype and limited treatment options. Notably, TNBC and other cancer cells exhibit heightened susceptibility to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to normal cells, suggesting a promising therapeutic window for BGNps. Despite this, systematic studies assessing BGNps&#8217; impact on critical cellular processes such as cell viability, genomic stability, and mitochondrial permeability in TNBC models are lacking. This represents a significant knowledge gap and highlights the urgent need for mechanistic investigations into their potential as selective, non-drug-based anticancer agents.</p><p id="Par8">To date, no published research has thoroughly examined the therapeutic effects of BGNps specifically in TNBC models. The absence of detailed mechanistic insights into their cytotoxicity, coupled with variability in nanoparticle synthesis, characterization, and assay methodologies, poses considerable obstacles to clinical translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Given the distinct physicochemical and biological behaviors of nanoparticles relative to their bulk counterparts, extrapolation from macroparticulate studies to nanoscale materials is unreliable without direct experimental validation. For addressing these critical gaps, the present study was conducted to explore the anticancer potential of BGNps against TNBC using the MDA-MB-231 cell line as a well-established in vitro model. Beyond evaluating general cytotoxicity, the current study aimed to investigate multiple mechanistic endpoints, including genomic DNA integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, intracellular ROS production, and apoptosis induction. Unlike prior studies focusing on BGNps as drug delivery platforms, this research uniquely examines their intrinsic cytotoxic properties, independent of chemotherapeutic loading. By elucidating the role of the ROS&#8211;mitochondria&#8211;DNA damage axis, the findings offer novel insights into BGNps&#8217; anticancer mechanisms and support their future development as safe, selective, and innovative nanotherapeutics for triple-negative breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par9">All chemicals used in this study were of high molecular-grade purity, particularly BGNps were procured from Nanotech Company (6th of October City, Cairo, Egypt) in fine white powdered form.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using an XPERT-PRO diffractometer (PANalytical, Netherlands) equipped with Cu K&#945; radiation (&#955;&#8201;=&#8201;1.5406 &#197;) to evaluate the crystalline versus amorphous nature of the particles. The obtained diffraction patterns were analyzed for characteristic peaks indicative of specific crystalline phases or broad halos representative of amorphous glassy structures. Particle size distribution and surface charge characteristics were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano Series (Malvern Instruments, USA). DLS measurements provided the hydrodynamic diameter, reflecting particle size in suspension, while zeta potential values were used to assess colloidal stability and predict the likelihood of aggregation. These parameters are critical for understanding nanoparticle dispersion behavior and their interactions with biological systems.</p><p id="Par12">Morphological features were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a Tecnai G20 Super Twin microscope (FEI, USA) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200&#160;kV. For sample preparation, a drop of BGNps suspension was carefully deposited onto carbon-coated copper grids, followed by air-drying at room temperature to preserve particle integrity. TEM imaging allowed direct visualization of particle shape, size, and aggregation state at the nanoscale, enabling cross-validation of the size data obtained from DLS. The combination of XRD, DLS, and TEM provided a comprehensive characterization of BGNps, ensuring a precise understanding of their physical attributes before their application in subsequent biological experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec98"><title>Propagation and cultivation of MDA-MB-231 cells</title><p id="Par13">Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a widely validated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, were purchased from the Regional Center for Mycology and Biotechnology (RCMB), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, which provides authenticated and contamination-free cell lines.

Briefly, equal volumes of MDA-MB-231 cell suspension and 20 &#181;M 2,7-DCFH-DA solution were gently mixed in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Upon entering the cells, 2,7-DCFH-DA was enzymatically deacetylated by intracellular esterases to yield non-fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH), which was subsequently oxidized by ROS to form the highly fluorescent compound 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The green fluorescence intensity emitted by DCF was directly proportional to intracellular ROS levels. Following incubation, stained cells were carefully spread as a thin monolayer on clean, pre-labeled glass microscope slides and examined under an epifluorescence microscope equipped with filters optimized for DCF detection. Fluorescent images were captured at 200&#215; magnification from randomly selected fields, ensuring identical exposure settings across all samples to allow for accurate comparison.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par48">Chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, its clinical benefits are often counterbalanced by severe systemic toxicities, rapid development of resistance, and high recurrence rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Patients commonly suffer from adverse toxic side effects such as myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal complications, which not only impair quality of life but also limit treatment compliance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, TNBC&#8217;s pronounced heterogeneity and the absence of defined molecular targets contribute to poor therapeutic outcomes and frequent relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. These limitations highlight the urgent need for novel, more targeted therapies that can selectively eradicate TNBC cells while minimizing harm to normal tissues.</p><p id="Par49">Nanotechnology-based therapeutics offer promising alternatives, providing enhanced tumor selectivity, controlled delivery, and the potential to overcome resistance pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In this regard, BGNps have gained increasing attention due to their excellent biocompatibility, tunable surface properties, and controlled release of therapeutic ions such as calcium, phosphate, and silicon, which are known to modulate essential cellular pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. While extensively applied in bone regeneration and antimicrobial therapy, their anticancer properties, particularly in TNBC, remain poorly defined. Accordingly, the present study explored the cytotoxic potential of BGNps against triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, with focus on estimating their ability to induce genomic instability, disrupt mitochondrial function, elevate ROS level, and trigger apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells.</p><p id="Par50">In this study BGNps exhibited potent, concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 184.3 &#181;g/ml after 72 h of exposure to two-fold increasing concentration of BGNps ranging from 7.8 to 1000 &#181;g/ml as displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. This pronounced cytotoxicity mirrors previous studies demonstrating the strong anticancer activity of bioactive glass-based formulations across various cancer models other than TNBC, where they were shown to effectively impair malignant cell viability while exerting comparatively lower toxicity toward non-cancerous cells. Such preferential activity has been largely attributed to the distinctive physicochemical features of BGNps, particularly their ability to release therapeutic ions and trigger cellular stress responses that disproportionately compromise rapidly dividing cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par51">

</p><p id="Par52">Mechanistically, BGNps triggered significant genomic DNA damage, as confirmed by the statistically significant increases in key alkaline Comet assay parameters; tail length, %DNA in tail and tail moment in highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, following 72 h of exposure to BGNps at the IC50 concentration value of 184.3 &#181;g/ml. These alterations reflect extensive fragmentation of genomic DNA and are consistent with nanoparticle-induced oxidative stress and genotoxicity reported across several cancer models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Given that DNA fragmentation is a defining feature of apoptosis, these results strongly suggest that BGNps initiate intrinsic apoptotic pathways in highly aggressive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p id="Par53">In addition to inducing genotoxic stress, our findings demonstrated pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction, a central event of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Screening mitochondrial membrane potential using Rhodamine-123, a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye, revealed a significant depolarization of mitochondrial membranes in BGNps-treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This loss of mitochondrial integrity is mechanistically consistent with the role of ROS in damaging mitochondrial membranes, thereby promoting cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, ROS measurement using 2&#8242;,7&#8242;-DCFH-DA confirmed a marked elevation in intracellular ROS generation level in BGNps-treated triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, reinforcing oxidative stress as a central mediator of BGNps-induced cytotoxicity. Notably, TNBC cells such as MDA-MB-231 are particularly vulnerable to oxidative injury due to their accelerated metabolic activity, elevated basal ROS production, and impaired oxidant defense capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. These intrinsic susceptibilities likely intensify BGNps-induced oxidative and mitochondrial damage, thereby amplifying their cytotoxic efficacy against this highly aggressive breast cancer subtype.</p><p id="Par55">Collectively, as displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> the findings from this study demonstrate that BGNps exert potent pro-apoptotic effects in triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by inducing severe genomic DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately driving the cells toward apoptotic cell death. Following 72-hour exposure to the IC50 concentration (184.3 &#181;g/ml) of BGNps, chromatin diffusion assay and DAPI nuclear staining revealed a significant increase in apoptotic nuclei, confirming that apoptosis is the primary mode of cell death triggered by BGNps. Microscopic examination further validated this apoptotic response. BGNps-treated MDA-MB-231 cancer cells exhibited hallmark nuclear alterations, including chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage, and fragmentation, along with the appearance of apoptotic bodies, classic morphological signatures of programmed cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. On contrary, these changes were absent in untreated control cells, which retained round, intact nuclei with uniform chromatin distribution. Such nuclear abnormalities strongly support the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, a pathway often engaged when intracellular stress surpasses the protective capacity of survival mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par56">The integration of our findings indicates that BGNps induce apoptosis in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through a coordinated, multi-step molecular mechanism. First, excessive ROS production overwhelms the inherently limited antioxidant defense capacity of TNBC cells, leading to extensive DNA strand breaks and severe genomic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Second, ROS-mediated damage compromise mitochondrial membrane integrity, resulting in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and subsequent activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic cascades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Third, this stress is further intensified by transcriptional dysregulation of apoptosis- and mitochondria-associated genes, which amplifies mitochondrial dysfunction and reinforces apoptotic signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par57">Consistently with these mechanisms, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed significant transcriptional reprogramming of apoptosis- and mitochondria-related genes in BGNps-treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Specifically, p53 expression was markedly upregulated following 72 h of treatment at the IC50 concentration. Upregulation of p53 following BGNps treatment represents a crucial event in initiating programmed cell death. p53, the guardian of the genome, acts as a key tumor suppressor that responds to DNA damage and oxidative stress by activating downstream apoptotic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. In TNBC, however, p53 is frequently mutated or functionally impaired, a defect strongly associated with therapeutic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Therefore, the observed reactivation or stabilization of p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells after BGNps exposure suggests that these nanoparticles may overcome defective p53 signaling and restore apoptotic competence. Once activated, p53 can induce apoptosis through transcription-dependent pathways, by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes, as well as transcription-independent mechanisms, including direct interactions with mitochondria and ROS-mediated signaling that promote cytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization, and dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par58">Conversely, downregulation of Bcl2, a key anti-apoptotic gene, shifts the balance toward apoptosis. Bcl2 normally stabilizes mitochondrial membranes and prevents cytochrome c release by antagonizing pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Reduced expression of Bcl2 gene 72-hours following BGNps treatment compromises this protective barrier, thereby sensitizing mitochondria to depolarization and facilitating activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Notably, several studies have reported that nanoparticle-induced oxidative stress downregulates Bcl2 while upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins, reinforcing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. In parallel, downregulation of ND3, a subunit of mitochondrial Complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC), further exacerbates mitochondrial stress. ND3 is essential for efficient electron transfer and ATP production. Its reduced expression disrupts ETC function, leading to electron leakage and accumulation of ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Elevated ROS not only cause additional DNA damage but also amplify mitochondrial depolarization, establishing a feed-forward loop that drives apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Thus, suppression of ND3 likely represents both a marker and a mediator of BGNps-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in TNBC cells.</p><p id="Par59">Taken together, the coordinated transcriptional reprogramming characterized by p53 upregulation, Bcl-2 downregulation, and ND3 downregulation orchestrates apoptosis in BGNps-treated triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. While p53 functions as a genomic stress sensor initiating apoptotic signaling, the loss of Bcl-2 removes mitochondrial protection, and suppression of ND3 compromises electron transport, further amplifying ROS generation. This integrated molecular cascade decisively shifts the balance toward intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis, positioning BGNps as a promising therapeutic candidate for TNBC, a subtype that is notoriously resistant to conventional treatments due to defective apoptotic regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par60">As depicted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> this study provides the first experimental evidence that BGNps induce apoptosis in TNBC cells through a multi-step mechanism involving ROS-mediated genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and transcriptional reprogramming of key apoptotic- and mitochondria-associated regulators. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insights on BGNps-induced anticancer potential and highlight their potential to overcome therapeutic resistance associated with impaired <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic> signaling, a hallmark of TNBC. Despite these promising findings, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study was conducted exclusively in a single in vitro TNBC model, without in vivo confirmation or long-term evaluation of nanoparticle toxicity, biodistribution, or resistance development. Additionally, downstream apoptotic mediators such as caspase activation were not fully characterized, and no direct comparison with standard chemotherapeutic agents was included. Therefore, future research should extend these findings by including normal breast epithelial cells, performing animal studies, and exploring combinatorial or comparative therapeutic approaches to comprehensively assess the safety, selectivity, and translational potential of BGNps in breast cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par61">Based on the above-discussed findings, it is concluded that BGNps exhibit strong cytotoxic activity against triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through a multifaceted mechanism involving ROS-induced genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and transcriptional dysregulation of key apoptotic and mitochondrial genes, ultimately activating intrinsic, <italic toggle="yes">p53</italic>-dependent apoptosis.
