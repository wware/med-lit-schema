Similar to other hormone-dependent cancers, such as prostate (PC) or endometrial cancers (EC) with loss of their associated HR (HR-PC or HR-EC) showing the dismal worse prognosis,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> these HR-BC, although accounting for only one quarter to one-third of all BC patients, are also associated with poor prognosis and the aforementioned the prognosis is particularly poor for those HR-BC patients combined with negative expression of HER2 (often called as triple-negative BC [TNBC]), which are often considered as a more aggressive and invasive tumor type of BC.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Due to far-advance technology of medical research and better understanding of pathophysiology of cancers, either HR+ or HER2 + BC can be more accurately and precisely used for prognostic prediction, treatment selection, and clinical trial inclusion, since these patients primarily receive hormonal therapy, with a subset also undergoing chemotherapy and HER2 + BC patients received the first-line treatment consisting of anti-HER2 therapy combined with either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (ET, aromatase inhibitor [AI], selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERM] or degraders [SERD]).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> By contrast, TNBC characterized by the absence of both HR and HER2 expressions (HR-/HER2-) represents very highly aggressive disease entities, with a rapid disease evolution, early metastases, and prompt dissemination.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therapeutic strategies to TNBC have long been anchored on multi-agent chemotherapy, with acceptable response; however, the duration of response (DOR) is very short, and nearly all TNBC patients will progress due to the development of resistance, limiting the long-term clinical benefits, resulting in the historical survival benchmark hovering median 13 months.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These findings indicate that the therapy for TNBC remains inadequate and the management of TNBC faces its greatest challenge, needing a breakthrough advance for treating TNBC patients. Therefore, much better understanding of underlying biological behaviors of TNBC is urgently needed. Any biomarker-guided agonistic treatment detected by new technology for TNBC is welcome.</p><p>Recently, Drs. Huang and Tseng&#8217;s group first attempted to use comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) via targeted sequencing or next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify actionable alternation in TNBC patients.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Consistent with the literature review,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Drs. Huang and Tseng&#8217;s data confirm that TNBC shows the most common actionable genes (occurring in &gt;10% of cases) were <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> (38%), <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> (25%), <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> (13%), <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> (13%), <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> (12%), and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB3</italic> (11%), and these frequencies were reduced to 22%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 4%, and 1% for <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PALB2</italic>, respectively, after applying a stringent per-variant filter.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, the authors identified TNBC with tumor mutation burden (TMB)-high or microsatellite instability (MSI) by investigating a broad range of genes and multi-gene signatures was associated with worse prognosis, since this finding appears more frequently in the advanced stage.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore, the authors commented that CGP could identify the actionable biomarkers to offer the potential to expand therapeutic opportunities for TNBC patients, although their conclusions were not offered by their current publication based on the absence of further correlated clinical analysis to validate their claims.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> We congratulate the authors on their successful work and appreciated their efforts to report the first TNBC-related CGP data. Based on the highly informative message, this article is worthy of further discussion.</p><p>First, although the standard of care (SOC) therapy to TNBC patients includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, much evidence supports immunotherapy and some targeted therapies should be integrated into the existing SOC therapy.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Among these, the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy (immunochemotherapy) may be one of the best acceptable therapeutic choices in the management of TNBC patients.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We totally agree with the authors&#8217; comments that TNBC is highly heterogeneous and lacks treatment options, and this therapy still faces significant challenges.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, immunochemotherapy, particularly for using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as the essential components of SOC treatment for TNBC patients, has, with little doubt, been highly recommended as the treatment of choice in place of chemotherapy alone to the TNBC patients if these TNBC patients are diagnosed the stage II and above.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Therefore, based on the findings by the authors&#8217; CGP data showing the proportion of TMB-high cases was lower among the early-stage patients compared to the late-stage patients (19% vs 36%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), it seemed to support the rationale of integration of ICIs into the conventional chemotherapy in the late-stage patients, and in fact, the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy has already been recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, the authors failed to include the stage II TNBC patients, since conventionally, stages I and II are classified as early stage.</p><p>However, is the aforementioned comment really reasonable? NCCN guidelines version 4.2025 suggests that all TNBC patients with stage II or higher disease should be treated with immunochemotherapy, regardless of whether it is applied by neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Additionally, this neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is applied to all corners of TNBC patients without any recommendation to whom it is fitted, suggesting NCCN guidelines do not limit the use of immunochemotherapy (ICIs + chemotherapy) in certain population of TNBC patients if stage &#8805;2. However, the aforementioned absence of biomarker guidance therapy by integration of ICIs into chemotherapy to the locally advanced and advanced TNBC patients creates confusion. Unlike the presence of mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for endometrial cancer and high expression of programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) detected by IHC and scored by combined positive score (CPS) for cervical cancer,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> it is unclear why the authors emphasized the more frequent detection of TMB and MSI is associated with higher and advanced stage of TNBC patients, since this information fails to add any information to determine who are suitable to the immunochemotherapy treatment. In fact, either TMB or MSI is one of the biomarkers indicating the cancer patients who are eligible for ICIs treatment.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, does the presence of either TMB-high or MSI suggest that the survival benefits of TNBC patients receive ICIs treatment? It is uncertain, since the biomarker-guided ICIs treatment for TNBC patients is well accepted by PD-L1 IHC, but the role of TMB-high or MSI is not suggested for TNBC cases. All suggest that the detection of TMB or MSI mediated by the relatively high cost of CGP may not fit in real-world clinical practice. The successful transformation from the statistical or scientific significance to the clinically meaningful practice in the real world is always kept in mind, since this part is really very important. Unfortunately, many publications have been in a quagmire to overclaim their statistical or scientific significance without real validation by clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>By contrast, the value of CGP for TNBC patients by authors can be found by detection of other genomic change, since there are many excited reports using these biomarkers-driven therapies in the successful management of various kinds of cancer patients, such as the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) for treating advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations; the use of PARPi combining with anti-angiogenesis agents (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] inhibitor) in the management of EOC patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD),<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> even for those patients who may be beneficial for de-escalation of overtreatment, such as DNA polymerase epsilon exonuclease ultramutated (<italic toggle="yes">POLE</italic>mut), which may escape the potential risk of treatment-related adverse events or complications.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the authors failed to discuss this part, although this part may not be the main aim of the current study. Even though there is an absence of clinical data to support their findings, we still welcome them to continue their work to publish their relevant results addressing this part.</p><p>Taken together, the aforementioned discussion does not influence the scientific and clinical value of Drs. Huang and Tseng&#8217;s group. The authors have really offered a real-world data to show the comprehensive genomic profile in TNBC patients, who still need better care. Additionally, the current therapeutic approach for TNBC is still clinically unmet, although ICIs are recommended as part of the treatment of choice. Furthermore, their report indicated a big unresolved problem; this very high expense evaluation indeed impede the widespread application to all TNBC patients worldwide. Moreover, without evidence to show the benefits after the application of CPG into the selection of biomarker-guided agonistic treatment strategies, this CGP may lose its original goal to offer the better prediction of outcome, and the guidance for the precise and accurate therapeutic choice for the majority of cancer patients. We believe that with continuing cost down of CGP and development of biomarker-driven targeted agents or molecules, the cancer patients may have a better chance to overcome the disease. The study by Drs. Huang and Tseng on TNBC using CGP is one of the best examples.</p><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (V113C-152, V114C-039, and V114B-015) and the Taiwan National Science and Technology Council, Executive Yuan (110-2314-B-075-016 MY3 and 113-2314-B-075-057 MY3), Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p>The authors appreciate the support from the Female Cancer Foundation, Taipei, Taiwan.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflicts of interest: Dr. Peng-Hui Wang, an editorial board member at the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, had no role in the peer review process of or decision to publish this article.
