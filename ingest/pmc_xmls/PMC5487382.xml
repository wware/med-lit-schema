Stem-cell therapy may offer an effective treatment option for individuals with hSCI. To examine the role of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation on hSCI and explore related mechanisms in the tree shrews, here, we created a model of hSCI by inducing injury at the tenth thoracic vertebra (T10). Hoechst 33342-labeled BMSCs derived from adult tree shrews were isolated, cultured, and implanted into the spinal cord around the injury site at 9 days after injury. The isolated BMSCs were able to survive, proliferate and release a variety of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. At 28 days after injury, compared with the sham group, the hSCI group displayed scar formation and dramatic elevations in the mean interleukin 1 beta (IL-1&#946;) density and cell apoptosis level, whereas the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic>) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (<italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic>) mRNA was reduced. Following BMSC transplantation, motoneurons extent of shrinkage were reduced and the animals&#8217; Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale scores were significantly higher at 21 and 28 days after injury when compared with the injured group. Moreover, the hSCI-induced elevations in scar formation, IL-1&#946;, and cell apoptosis were reduced by BMSC transplantation to levels that were close to those of the sham group. Corresponding elevations in the expression of <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic> mRNA were observed in the hSCI + BMSCs group, and the levels were not significantly different from those observed in the sham group. Together, our results support that grafted BMSCs can significantly improve locomotor function in tree shrews subjected to hSCI and that this improvement is associated with the upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tree shrews</kwd><kwd>bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>cell transplantation</kwd><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>CNTF</kwd><kwd>cell apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministry of Science and Technology of the People&#8217;s Republic of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002855</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">No. 2014BAI01B10</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">supported by the Program of Innovative Research Team In Science and Technology in Yunnan province (IRTSTYN)</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="62"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="8713"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is often associated with a low quality of life and high mortality (Zompa et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Currently, treating SCI is a challenge, as existing therapies are expensive and provide unsatisfactory functional improvement. Traditionally, it was believed that the nerves in the central nervous system (CNS) of mature mammals could not regenerate after injury owing to the poor regenerative capability of neurons and inhibition from the glial microenvironment. However, Aguayo et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>) discovered that injured axons in the CNS could regenerate in a suitable environment, thus fostering the development of new approaches for revealing the mechanisms underlying this regeneration and repair, with the aim of establishing optimal therapeutic strategies for individuals with SCI.</p><p>Cell transplantation, as a method of biotherapy, is an effective treatment method for neurological diseases (Chopp et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Hofstetter et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), multipotent stromal cells that are derived from bone marrow (M&#233;ndez-Ferrer et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), support hematopoiesis and generate cells in the mesodermal layers (Garfias et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recently, the administration of BMSCs has been shown to downregulate T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and antigen-presenting cells by cell-to-cell interactions and soluble factor production (Kassis et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Besides their immunomodulatory effects, BMSCs also have the potential for self-renewal and multipotency and can secrete neurotrophic factors (NTFs; M&#233;ndez-Ferrer et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These immunomodulatory and neuroprotective features imply that BMSCs may serve as potential candidates for future therapeutic modalities in SCI.</p><p>Numerous previous studies have shown that BMSC transplantation dose-dependently promotes functional improvement and even alleviates the symptoms of neuropathic pain during or after the spinal shock period in rat, dog, rabbit, monkey and even human models of SCI (Pal et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Amr et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mendon&#231;a et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Torres-Esp&#237;n et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Xia et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Satti et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Yousefifard et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the ability of BMSCs to promote functional remodeling after SCI are likely related to the anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic proprieties of these cells, which exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects at the injury site; additionally, BMSCs induce the repair of nerve cells, promote axonal regeneration, and restore nerve trophism by secreting NTFs (Ohta et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Neuhuber et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Abrams et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sakata et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Tran et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Uccelli et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Xia et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Abbaszadeh et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These effects translate into functional improvement, as a study using a dog model of SCI demonstrated that both autologous and allogenic BMSC transplantation improved neurological function following SCI and noted that these improvements were associated with reduced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 levels (Jung et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ryu et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These findings support that BMSC transplantation may be an effective treatment for SCI. However, most prior studies have focused on BMSCs derived from rats, while few investigations have examined the role of BMSC in primate models of SCI. Therefore, new animal models that more closely resemble humans are needed.</p><p>The tree shrews (<italic toggle="yes">Tupaia belangeri</italic>) are small mammals that are mainly distributed in the Torrid Zone and subtropical zone of Southeast Asia (Peng et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Because of a close relationship to primates in terms of the biological characteristics, biochemistry, metabolism, physiology and genome (Pawlik et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Cao et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Janecka et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Fan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the tree shrew has got wide attention. Moreover, the tree shrews has been increasingly used as a viable model animal, and are proposed to be an alternative experimental animal to rodents and primates in biomedical research, as they have several characteristics including low cost of maintenance, small adult body size, high brain-to-body mass ratio, a short reproductive cycle, and can be more easily obtained than monkeys (Cao et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Fuchs and Corbach-S&#246;hle, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Fan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (Yamashita et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lin et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the tree shrew has also been successfully used as an animal model of liver disease (Zhao et al., <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), depression (Wang et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), myopia (Norton et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), bacterial infection (Li et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and learning behaviors (Bartolomucci et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Hence, the tree shrew has the potential to serve as a viable model for cell transplantation in translational studies examining SCI.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of BMSC transplantation in a tree shrew model of SCI. To do this, we cultured BMSCs that were isolated from the healthy tree shrews <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and evaluated their morphology, proliferation and NTF expression levels, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&#946;1), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Hemi-transected spinal cord injury (hSCI) was then induced in tree shrews. Subsequently, the Hoechst 33342-labeled BMSCs were transplanted into the injured spinal cord to determine their <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> effects on locomotor function in the hind limbs, glial scar formation, the inflammatory response, cell apoptosis and motoneurons.

Cell suspension was implanted into the spinal cord by the insertion of a pored glass pipette attached to a micro-injector carrying a capillary glass microelectrode (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Six sites with 2 mm depth were selected at the following coordinates: two sites 5 mm rostral to the injured site, two sites 5 mm caudal to the injured site, one site 0.5 mm left and one site 0.5 mm right to the injured site.

In addition, Hoechst-labeled BMSCs were able to survive and migrate in tree shrews subjected to hSCI. These findings confirmed that BMSCs possessed the characteristics of stem cells and that they could be transplanted effectively. Previous studies have shown that BMSCs exhibit the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into various cell lineages of mesenchymal origin, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, endothelial and neuronal cells (Friedenstein et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>). Additionally, BMSCs can suppress the immune response after transplantation and simultaneously maintain their multi-directional differentiation potential (Rossignol et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Maggini et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Together, these findings support that BMSCs may be a valuable tool for promoting nerve repair after SCI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>BMSC Transplantation Promotes Functional Improvement in Tree Shrews Subjected to hSCI</title><p>Over the last few decades, GFP/DAPI/Hoechst-labeled BMSC transplantation has been shown to exert protective effects by promoting axonal regeneration, inhibiting cell apoptosis, and inducing the repair of nerve cells in rat models of radiation-induced multi-organ failure syndrome (Chapel et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), myocardial infarct (Shake et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), SCI (Zhou et al., <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and brain injury (Tanna and Sachan, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Meanwhile, BMSCs were considered as vehicles, for gene delivery like GDNF or BDNF in the brain (Chen et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). However, as mentioned earlier, most of these studies were performed in rats. Since tree shrews share a more close relationship to primates than rodents (Fan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), using this animal as a model may help reveal the potential therapeutic abilities of BMSC transplantation for humans. Therefore, in the present study, we used a tree shrew model to examine the effects of BMSC transplantation after hSCI. Our results showed that BMSC transplantation significantly protected the motorneurons and augmented the shrews&#8217; BBB scores at day 21 and day 28 after injury, indicating that the grafted BMSCs improved the motor function of tree shrews with hSCI. Furthermore, BMSC transplantation significantly reduced glial scar formation, the inflammatory response and cell apoptosis in the tree shrew model of hSCI. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that BMSC transplantation had a positive effect on motor functional recovery after hSCI in tree shrews.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Possible Molecular Events Involved in BMSC Transplantation</title><p>Here, we found that <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in the hSCI + BMSCs group, while the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Merk</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PI3K</italic> did not change. Previously, CNTF was shown to rescue various types of adult CNS neurons, including striatal, cholinergic forebrain, and dopaminergic midbrain neurons, as well as motoneurons, in several disease models (Hagg and Varon, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Mitsumoto et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Anderson et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), thus demonstrating that CNTF plays important protective roles in several diseases. As for SCI, one study found that <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CNTFR</italic> mRNA expression increased dramatically at day 1 after hSCI in T2, then declined between days 1 and 5, and finally returned to normal by day 10, suggesting that CNTF may play a local role in the response to SCI (Oyesiku et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In comparison, we found that <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic> mRNA expression in the area caudal to the SCI dramatically declined by 28 days after hSCI in T10; however, this reduction in <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic> mRNA expression did not occur in the hSCI + BMSCs group, as the level was similar to that observed for the sham group. Increasing evidence suggests that NTFs can alter the balance between neurite re-growth-inhibiting and -inducing molecules. As a result, these NTFs, particularly CNTF, can promote cell survival and axonal re-growth over neurodegeneration (M&#252;ller et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Abbaszadeh et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition, CNTF has been speculated to improve the efficacy of cell transplantation, highlighting the important role CNTF plays during BMSC transplantation in the rat SCI model (Abbaszadeh et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interestingly, STAT3, a downstream signaling molecule of CNTF, was also altered in our study, the results showed the expression level of <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> was significantly upregulated after BMSC transplantation, indicating that endogenous synthesis of STAT3 was triggered. Moreover, in order to exclude the effects of immunosuppression on the <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> mRNA levels, all tree shrews were treated with cyclosporin-A. Therefore, we speculate that BMSC transplantation improved motor function in tree shrews subjected to hSCI by increasing the <italic toggle="yes">CNTF</italic>-regulated <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that BMSC transplantation into the injured spinal cord could improve motor function of tree shrews after hSCI, and that possible mechanisms are associated with <italic toggle="yes">CNTF-</italic>regulated <italic toggle="yes">STAT3</italic> signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>L-LX, FL and T-HW designed the experiments.
