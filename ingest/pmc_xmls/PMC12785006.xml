However, some cases exhibit primary resistance or develop secondary resistance to AI therapy. Nutrition appears to play a pivotal role in the patient&#8217;s journey from diagnosis onward, significantly influencing the clinical response to AI therapy. This review presents the interactions of various nutrients found in foods or dietary supplements, elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which Ais&#8217; efficacy may be either attenuated or enhanced.

Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer (BC) remains a major global health challenge, characterized by rising incidence rates, and is the subject of intensive worldwide research. Statistics indicate that the breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies globally and remains the leading cause of death among the female population [<xref rid="B1-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, approximately 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths were reported globally in 2020, representing a pressing public health concern [<xref rid="B1-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to a recent study, countries with a high human development index exhibit a higher incidence of BC but a lower mortality rates, primarily due to the implementation of screening programs, early diagnosis, and access to advanced treatments [<xref rid="B4-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, countries with a lower human development index report significantly higher mortality rates [<xref rid="B4-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to current data, incidence rates are lowest in Africa and most of Asia, reaching intermediate levels in Eastern Europe and South America, whereas Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe and North America report higher rates [<xref rid="B5-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In terms of ethnicity and race, the highest incidences were recorded in White women, followed by Black women, and the lowest rates were observed in Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native women [<xref rid="B6-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is well-established that BC is a complex disease driven by a combination of external and internal factors. Its occurrence is rare before the age of 35, while the incidence increases significantly within the interval of 40&#8211;60 years of age [<xref rid="B7-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The risk factors involved in BC development are categorized into non-modifiable factors such as BRCA1, BRCA2 genetic mutations, female sex, family history, and advanced age, as well as modifiable factors including obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet [<xref rid="B10-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Currently, BC treatment strategies encompass a wide range of options including a &#8220;less is more&#8221; surgical approach, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy [<xref rid="B13-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is a growing recognition that nutritional status plays a critical role during BC treatment and recovery, significantly impacting the patient&#8217;s quality of life [<xref rid="B14-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Patients diagnosed with BC often seek to optimize their nutritional habits by adopting specific nutritional regimes, using natural products or various vitamin and mineral supplements. Substantial evidence indicates that calcium and vitamin D supplements, along with natural products such as fish oil, omega 3-fatty acids, and turmeric, are frequently used as adjuvants by patients undergoing endocrine therapy [<xref rid="B15-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent research indicates that certain adverse reactions to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, such as osteoporosis, can be alleviated through lifestyle changes including regular physical activity, eating a balanced diet, and the supplementation of calcium and vitamin D [<xref rid="B16-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Numerous patients adhere to the Mediterranean diet, which is considered an attractive concept due to its potential to reduce BC risk and, for those already diagnosed, to improve prognosis by decreasing the risk of recurrence [<xref rid="B17-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The concept of the Mediterranean diet specifically refers to a high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil; a moderate consumption of fish, poultry, and dairy products; and limited intake of refined sugars and red meat [<xref rid="B18-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to the high content of fibers, antioxidants, monosaturated acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, this dietary pattern is considered one of the healthiest; it exerts anti-inflammatory effects, increases insulin sensitivity, and reduces oxidative stress [<xref rid="B20-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, concerns have been raised about the potential of these dietary interventions and supplements to interact with medications within the therapeutic regimens.</p><p>Another study has also shown that obesity is a key factor correlated with disease progression, recurrence, and resistance to endocrine treatment [<xref rid="B21-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recent findings highlight that obese BC patients treated with AIs generally present with unfavorable outcomes, exhibiting higher rates of recurrence and mortality compared to those of non-obese patients [<xref rid="B22-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Various spices, foods, dietary supplements, and plant extracts may potentially interfere with AIs. From a clinical perspective, one of the primary concerns for this patient population is &#8220;What am I allowed to eat and what should I avoid?&#8221; Beyond the standard contraindications against alcohol consumption and smoking, there is an ongoing debate regarding the interactions between AIs and diet. This includes the intake of complex food and supplements and whether they contain a single substance or a whole plant extract. In this narrative review, we discuss the recommended dietary regimen for patients with BC receiving AIs. These discussions, which sometimes border controversy, aim to elucidate the mechanisms of interactions from both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic point of view and to explain the potential benefits or disadvantages of certain natural products. This remains challenging because whole foods of natural origin consist of complex mixtures of bioactive substances, which can produce effects that differ from those of their isolated components. To this end, we have provided an overview of the currently established mechanism in the field, incorporating studies and expert opinions. Our objective is to identify scientifically justified solutions and dietary practices that are beneficial for BC patients undergoing AI treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-cancers-18-00073"><title>2. Methodology</title><p>This narrative review aims to present the current scientific evidence regarding the types of foods and supplements recommended for patients with BC undergoing AI therapy. To achieve this, we examine how AIs modulate estrogen production, the clinical consequences of these agents, and the effects of bioactive compounds from exogenous natural sources.</p><p>In the first section, we describe the role of aromatase in estrogen biosynthesis and provide the structural details of AIs widely used today, specifically, letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane. For this description, the previously mentioned review articles have proven the most useful contributions to the conception of the initial schemes in the manuscript. In the second section, we examine the pharmacodynamic interactions between AIs and specific molecules introduced through dietary intake, alongside recent publications regarding their effects on ER or aromatase and their influences on AIs&#8217; efficiency. Compounds with well-established and widely studied antiproliferative effects were also included. We searched for original articles and systematic reviews encompassing clinical and preclinical studies that demonstrate the described effects, and here, we outline the clinical consequences and explain their mechanisms of action. The composition and chemical structures of these nutrients were primarily documented from review articles. In the section dedicated to natural products that may inhibit the activity of AIs, we address the common clinical practice among oncologists/gynecologists of advising against the consumption of soy, milk, and sesame products. We present scientific evidence from various studies that either support or refute this practice. To ensure objectivity, we also examine pharmacokinetic factors, even though such interactions are not traditionally considered clinically relevant for AIs.</p><p>To accomplish this purpose, we used the scientific databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Scopus using the following search terms: &#8220;breast cancer&#8221;, &#8220;aromatase&#8221;, &#8220;aromatase inhibitors&#8221;, &#8220;exemestane&#8221;, &#8220;anastrozole&#8221;, &#8220;letrozole&#8221;, &#8220;estrogen&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Humulus lupus</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Glycyrrhiza</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;citrus fruit&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Juniperus procera</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;cannabidiol&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Curcuma longa</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Zingiber officinale</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;honey&#8221;, &#8220;sweet potato&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Punica granatum</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Momordica charantia</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Prunus avium</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;resveratrol&#8221;, &#8220;vitamin D&#8221;, &#8220;vitamin C&#8221;, &#8220;soy&#8221;, &#8220;sesame&#8221;, &#8220;phatmacokinetics&#8221;, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">Hypericum perforatum</italic>&#8221;, and various combinations among them. The search prioritized publications from the last 5 years. However, when data were insufficient&#8212;particularly in the final section or regarding clinical and preclinical trial results for key findings&#8212;we extended the search period back to 2015. We excluded non-peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, editorials, letters to the editor, and editorial notes. The search strategy was flexible, taking into account both specific mechanistic details and the information necessary for the introductory parts of each section and subsection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-cancers-18-00073"><title>3. Structural Considerations and Mechanisms of Action That Could Be Influenced by Natural Bioactive Compounds</title><sec id="sec3dot1-cancers-18-00073"><title>3.1. Aromatase: Key Enzyme, Therapeutic Target of Aromatase Inhibitors</title><p>Estrogens are a class of steroid hormones with 18 carbon atoms synthesized in the human body comprising three active compounds: estradiol, the most potent and prevalent form, along with estriol and estrone [<xref rid="B23-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They are produced by the ovaries with smaller quantities synthesized by the adrenal gland, placenta, liver, nervous system, and adipose tissue [<xref rid="B25-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Estrogen biosynthesis originates from cholesterol and proceeds to androstenedione, following several transformations common to testosterone synthesis. From the androstenedione onward, aromatase plays a key role (<xref rid="cancers-18-00073-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In the initial stage of this common pathway, progesterone is formed through the dehydrogenation of pregnenolone followed by its conversion to androstenedione. Androstenedione can subsequently follow two metabolic paths: transformation into testosterone mediated by 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or conversion into estrone via the action of aromatase [<xref rid="B27-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Estrone, in turn, will be converted either into estriol or estradiol, the latter of which can be subsequently transformed to estriol [<xref rid="B29-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, aromatase plays a crucial role in estrogen biosynthesis by acting on either testosterone or androstenedione, yielding the three primary estrogens which can undergo interconversion [<xref rid="B30-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Consequently, the production of estrogens can be inhibited in the human body by targeting aromatase with AIs.</p><p>Once malignant transformation and proliferation occur in estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive BC, aromatase activity increases in correlation with the disease stage progression and the intensity of progesterone receptor expression [<xref rid="B31-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Differences in aromatase activity may result from posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in the presence of BC, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. It has been demonstrated that PTMs might enhance the conversion of androstenedione to estrogens followed by increased aromatase expression in the presence of estradiol [<xref rid="B32-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The process occurs in the context of ER&#945;-mediated signaling, which is considered the primary driver of growth and proliferation of this type of BC [<xref rid="B33-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Aromatase Inhibitors: Structure and Properties</title><p>Following BC diagnosis and staging, the focus shifts to therapeutic strategies, with a growing interest in adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments. It has been demonstrated that approximately 70% of invasive breast cancers are hormone-receptor-positive tumors. These respond to therapies that inhibit ER signaling pathways, including AIs (letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane), selective ER modulators like tamoxifen, and ER down-regulators such as fulvestrant [<xref rid="B42-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Tamoxifen was a breakthrough therapy in the management of breast cancer patients when it was introduced in the late 1960s and approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977 [<xref rid="B43-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the current clinical landscape, there is a trend toward replacing tamoxifen with AIs in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, several clinical trials in premenopausal patients have indicated superior outcomes when combining aromatase inhibitors with ovarian function suppression (OFC), compared to that of tamoxifen plus OFC, or tamoxifen monotherapy [<xref rid="B45-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Another aspect to consider is that approximately one-third of ER + BC cases develop tamoxifen resistance, which has a negative impact on the patient&#8217;s prognosis [<xref rid="B46-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Consequently, alternative endocrine therapies must be evaluated [<xref rid="B47-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, aromatase inhibitors are being increasingly explored as an alternative to tamoxifen in specific clinical scenarios. Although tamoxifen offered treatment advantages comparable to those of first- and second-generation aromatase inhibitors, the third-generation AIs have demonstrated superior efficacy [<xref rid="B43-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women results in an additional proportional reduction in recurrence rates of approximately 30% [<xref rid="B48-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Within the third generation of AIs, letrozole and anastrozole are non-steroidal compounds, while exemestane is a steroidal AI [<xref rid="B49-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Some research comparing the third-generation aromatase inhibitors found that the best 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was associated with letrozole, followed by exemestane, while the poorest outcome was observed with anastrozole [<xref rid="B50-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Chemically, exemestane has a similar structure to the natural substrate, androstenedione (<xref rid="cancers-18-00073-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Both exemestane and its active metabolite 17&#946;-dihydroexemestane irreversibly bind to the active site of aromatase [<xref rid="B51-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this way, aromatase remains inactivated even after the drug has been cleared from the body [<xref rid="B52-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Letrozole and anastrozole cause a reversible competitive inhibition of aromatase by establishing non-covalent bonds with the heme group of aromatase. Structurally (<xref rid="cancers-18-00073-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), both substances carry an imidazole ring [<xref rid="B30-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B53-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

Moreover, patients undergoing treatment with AIs may experience ophthalmic adverse effects, including dry eyes, decreased visual acuity, and retinal hemorrhage [<xref rid="B58-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Among postmenopausal women with BC receiving AIs, symptoms such as vaginal dryness, decreased libido, and dyspareunia are frequently described; these affect the quality of sexual life and may therefore compromise treatment adherence [<xref rid="B59-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Metabolic disruption, such as dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, weight gain, and abdominal obesity, has been observed during AI therapy [<xref rid="B60-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, cognitive dysfunction is commonly associated with the depletion of estrogen resulting from this treatment [<xref rid="B62-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

Several structures stand out in this regard: 6-prenylnaringenin, xanthohumol-isoxanthohumol pair, which subsequently converted to 8-prenylnaringenin found in hops, and licochalcone A, 8-prenylapigenin, isoliquiritigenin-liquiritigenin pair identified in licorice [<xref rid="B71-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Among these substances, liquiritigenin appears to be the most promising for antitumor activity.

This effect is further amplified by the capacity of liquiritigenin to reduce tumor invasiveness by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating N-cadherin expressions. Furthermore, it triggers apoptosis by increasing caspase 3 activity [<xref rid="B75-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Another advantage of these compounds is the delay in osteoporosis onset for estrogen-depleted women, an effect induced by HHL phytoestrogens [<xref rid="B76-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Other studies highlight the anti-carcinogenic effect of xanthohumol and 6-prenylnaringenin, which act by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggering apoptosis in BC cells [<xref rid="B77-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The potent anti-tumor effect of xanthohumol on BC cells has been further confirmed by meta-analysis [<xref rid="B79-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Conversely, some authors suggest that HHL should be avoided in the presence of BC or other estrogen-dependent cancers, as phytoestrogens (especially 8-prenylnaringenin and 6-prenylnaringenin) act as agonists on both ER-&#945; and ER-&#946; [<xref rid="B80-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].

Citrus Fruits, Including Their Peel</title><p>Citrus fruits, including their peel, are a source of flavonoids, among which the following substances stand out for their inhibitory effect on aromatase in a similar manner to letrozole: naringenin, quercetin, naringin [<xref rid="B82-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], hesperidin [<xref rid="B83-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], and nobiletin [<xref rid="B84-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This property has been demonstrated by in silico studies and validated on MCF-7 BC cell lines (ER&#945;+) derived from metastatic carcinoma both directly or after inoculation into athymic mice [<xref rid="B82-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In brief, naringenin and quercetin interact with the aromatase hydrophobic catalytic domain specifically at the sterol-binding site.

In the case of nobiletin [<xref rid="B84-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], aromatase activity in the MCF-7 cell line was inhibited only at low concentrations, specifically, 0.1 &#181;mol/L. Although these findings are notable, the combination of letrozole with nobiletin showed no effect on aromatase activity [<xref rid="B84-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].

RO contains two compounds that inhibit aromatase in a dose-dependent manner: ursolic acid and kaempferol [<xref rid="B94-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Due to its structural similarity to androstenedione, ursolic acid appears to attach to the sterol derivative binding site of aromatase through hydrophobic interactions [<xref rid="B94-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that ursolic acid possesses AI properties similar to those of exemestane and letrozole; however, its downregulation of the enzyme is attributed to the silencing of aromatase gene transcription [<xref rid="B95-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Unlike ursolic acid, kaempferol acts directly on the catalytic center of the enzyme [<xref rid="B94-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], suggesting a competitive mechanism. Aromatase inhibition elicited by kaempferol is relatively modest, reaching 30% at a concentration of 10 &#181;M and 50% at 50 &#181;M [<xref rid="B94-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].

Thus, resveratrol has been shown to inhibit phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (a key enzyme in the Meyerhoff&#8211;Embden pathway) in BT-549 cells, thereby blocking glycolysis [<xref rid="B232-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Simultaneously, fatty acid &#946;-oxidation is inactivated through the alteration of the carnitine/acylcarnitine fatty acid transport system across the mitochondrial membrane in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="B233-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Furthermore, resveratrol inhibits fatty acid synthase, which is usually overexpressed in BC [<xref rid="B234-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot8-cancers-18-00073"><title>4.2.8. Vitamin D</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency, specifically, low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is a common feature observed in patients with BC [<xref rid="B235-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>,<xref rid="B236-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. The primary biological role is played by calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), the active metabolite with the most potent biological activity. The co-administration of calcitriol with AIs contributes to a reduction in tumor proliferation in the MCF-7 cell line [<xref rid="B235-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>] by downregulating ER&#945; mRNA expression [<xref rid="B237-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. This downregulation of ER&#945; induced by the concomitant administration of calcitriol and the 1,24-dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative enhanced the efficacy of anastrozole in mice with MCF-7 induced BC [<xref rid="B238-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. On the other hand, since BC patients treated with AIs face an increased risk of developing osteoporosis, vitamin D supplementation is a routine practice in these cases [<xref rid="B239-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>,<xref rid="B240-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. Another benefit of vitamin D observed in BC patients is the reduced expression of proinflammatory markers IL-6 and TNF&#945; alongside an increase in the IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio. These effects were significant at doses of 4000 IU/day but were not observed at a dose of 2000 IU/day [<xref rid="B241-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>].

Vitamin C</title><p>Vitamin C is utilized as a complementary therapy in BC, exhibiting antiproliferative effects at high doses against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines resistant to chemotherapy and hormone therapy (e.g., docetaxel, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen) [<xref rid="B243-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. Evidence suggests that high doses of vitamin C inhibit NF-kB, thereby sensitizing BC cells to hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy [<xref rid="B244-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. In one study, vitamin C was administered intravenously to a cohort of 350 patients with BC undergoing concurrent hormone, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments. At a dosage of 25 g/week for four weeks, an improvement in quality of life was observed specifically through a reduction in the severity of vomiting, pain, fatigue, and appetite loss [<xref rid="B245-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Furthermore, the co-administration of vitamin C with BC-specific treatment led to an improvement in overall survival (OS), a finding highlighted by a recent systematic review [<xref rid="B246-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the indirect antiproliferative effects of certain biologically active natural compounds are mediated by the modulation of specific signaling pathways. Activation of PI3k/Akt/mTOR and its related pathways, which is frequently upregulated in cancer cells, leads to cell growth, proliferation, protein synthesis, and angiogenesis, while simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis. Consequently, most of these compounds induce apoptosis and trigger cell cycle arrest, thereby reducing the viability of BC cells. Furthermore, they possess the potential to inhibit angiogenesis. These effects are mediated through both cellular and extracellular mechanisms, such as the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines by MC and vitamin D. It should be noted that these findings have been demonstrated exclusively in cell cultures and animal models. <xref rid="cancers-18-00073-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> summarizes these mechanisms alongside the described biological effects and modulatory influences of natural bioactive compounds. These natural extracts demonstrate potent antitumor activity, particularly when used in high concentrations or as a complex formulation. Although in vitro or in vivo studies in laboratory animals are conclusive, long-term results in humans are not so satisfactory. Further research is needed to improve the bioavailability of these natural compounds and the benefits of their maximum potential observed in lab experiments.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-cancers-18-00073"><title>5.

Soy</title><p>Soy contains isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein (<xref rid="cancers-18-00073-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), which possess a structure similar to 17-&#946;-estradiol, enabling them to activate ER [<xref rid="B247-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>,<xref rid="B248-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. Bennetau-Pelissero C [<xref rid="B249-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>] emphasized that genistein and daidzein may promote the proliferation of ER + BC cells. Moreover, other authors [<xref rid="B250-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>] have suggested that these soy-derived isoflavones can reduce the overall efficacy of AIs. Conversely, an in vitro study demonstrated that genistein in combination with exemestane enhances the antiproliferative effect in AI-sensitive MCF-7 and AI-resistant LTED BC cell cultures. These effects were not observed for letrozole and anastrozole. The authors attributed this finding to the fact that genistein, unlike estradiol, binds with an affinity of 87% to ER&#946; and only 4% to ER&#945; [<xref rid="B67-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Several studies found no association between soy and genistein consumption and increased BC risk [<xref rid="B251-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>,<xref rid="B252-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>], particularly at moderate intakes of 25&#8211;25 mg/day [<xref rid="B253-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. However, the risk appeared to increase with each additional 30 g/day [<xref rid="B254-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>] increment.

Milk</title><p>Milk is a food source that potentially contains estrogen-like compounds capable of binding to ER. It is well established that milk contains estrone sulfate and estradiol, both of which remain stable during heat processing [<xref rid="B240-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. Their effects on ER&#945; in BC are potentiated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a major activator of the mTORC-1 pathway [<xref rid="B258-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>,<xref rid="B259-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. In turn, mTORC-1 activates the transcriptional activity of ER&#945; [<xref rid="B258-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. Another component found in bovine milk, zearalenone, is also capable of activating both ER&#945; and ER&#946; [<xref rid="B260-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. In addition to these factors, the role of bisphenol&#8212;present in UHT milk packaging&#8212;in BC pathogenesis should not be overlooked [<xref rid="B261-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>,<xref rid="B262-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>]. Given the controversy surrounding the association between high dairy intake and BC development [<xref rid="B258-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>,<xref rid="B263-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>,<xref rid="B264-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>,<xref rid="B265-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>], it is recommended that patients avoid bovine milk and dairy products following an ER + BC diagnosis. The rationale for this recommendation includes both the potential interference with AIs and the pro-proliferative role associated with this type of food. Nevertheless, conflicting evidence exists; one study highlights the benefits of dairy-derived peptides regarding their antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects on BC [<xref rid="B266-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>], while another study found no significant association between dairy consumption and BC [<xref rid="B267-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Another study associated fermented dairy products with a protective effect in women with ER + BC, whereas high-fat dairy products did not exhibit this benefit [<xref rid="B268-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>]. In another investigation, milk consumption was associated with a reduced risk of both pre- and postmenopausal BC [<xref rid="B269-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. This finding is supported by other authors who emphasize that moderate consumption of approximately two servings/day may be beneficial [<xref rid="B270-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>].

This effect is mediated by the activation of steroidogenesis influenced by the PI3k/protein kinase A or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 signaling pathways [<xref rid="B274-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>,<xref rid="B275-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>]. A review study [<xref rid="B276-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>] highlights the effects of sesamin, identified in other seed species. According to the authors, sesamin does not influence aromatase activity but activates ER&#945; and ER&#946; through estrogen-like action. Another report describes the antiproliferative effect of sesamin on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines [<xref rid="B277-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Furthermore, sesamol has been shown to exert a protective effect against lung injury induced as an adverse effect of cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy agent usually used in BC treatment [<xref rid="B278-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. Although several studies suggest that sesamin&#8212;in combination with other compounds from sesame seeds and oil (sesamol, sesamolin, campesterol, and stigmasterol) and sunflower seeds and oil (quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, apigenin, CA, and coumaric acid)&#8212;may prevent BC development [<xref rid="B279-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>], its role in ER + BC remains controversial.

This practice should occasionally be questioned, as it is largely based on theoretical considerations due to a lack of sufficient clinical studies to justify it. Occasionally, for foods of natural origin, simply avoiding the parts containing substances with estrogenic activity may be a sufficient preventive measure. For example, while the pulp and peel of PG exhibit antiproliferative properties mentioned above, the seeds are rich in sterols and steroids including stigmasterol, &#946;-sitosterol, camesterol, cholesterol, 17-&#945;-estradiol, estrone, testosterone, and estriol [<xref rid="B185-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>,<xref rid="B280-cancers-18-00073" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>].

Other vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower should also be mentioned, as they are rich in glucosinolates that generate indole-3-carbinol and isothiocyanates, particularly sulforaphane.

Conclusions</title><p>Patients with ER + BC undergoing AI treatment should consider their dietary choices to optimize therapeutic efficacy. Certain natural products and dietary supplements derived from licorice, rosemary, juniper, cannabis, and citrus fruits may act as competitive aromatase inhibitors. Consequently, their consumption must be carefully monitored and adjusted, as they could potentially interfere with AI therapy. Other nutrients and foods&#8212;including honey, ginger, turmeric, sweet potatoes, pomegranates, bitter melon, dark sweet cherries, and resveratrol&#8212;are recommended for oncological patients due to their antiproliferative properties demonstrated in both in vivo and in vitro investigations. Patients with ER + BC frequently take vitamins D and C to mitigate certain adverse effects of AIs. Conversely, some natural compounds exhibit estrogen-like activity (soy, cow&#8217;s milk, seeds, and sesame oil), raising controversy regarding their potential to reduce the efficacy of AI therapy. Precautions are necessary when combining certain vegetables that may interact pharmacokinetically from a theoretical point of view by interfering with CYP systems. These interferences can occur through enzymatic inhibition (e.g., grapefruit juice) or enzymatic induction (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Hypericum perforatum</italic>, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or cauliflower) of AI metabolism. Although these aspects may not seem significant at first glance, they can influence the overall therapeutic response in the long term. Therefore, the treating physician has an obligation to inform patients with ER + BC about which foods are recommended, which should be avoided, and which require special precautions during AI treatment.</p><p>The conclusions in this narrative review are subject to certain limitations. Specifically, the properties of biologically active compounds described herein were identified in preclinical investigations including in silico, in vitro, and in vivo animal models. The exact data are unavailable regarding the actual effects on living human tissue or the concentrations these biologically active compounds reached within BC tissue of patients. Furthermore, certain conflicting results regarding these substances are discussed, emphasizing that definitive conclusions can only be drawn within the specific experimental conditions under which they were carried out.</p><p>Further research involving larger patient cohorts is warranted. Current clinical trials investigating the associations between anticancer agents and specific foods, active principles or food supplements are often conducted over limited periods, leaving a knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes. The mechanisms influenced by specific natural substances could serves as starting points for the synthesis and modulation of anticancer drugs. These developments may significantly contribute to the future eradication of BC and cancer in general. The bioactive principles and natural compounds discussed herein provide a basis for identifying the conditions under which, reach therapeutically effective concentrations can be reached within the target tissue. This is particularly relevant in the context of a varied diet, rather than the consumption of a single food item. For nutritional products purchased from retail chains, the presence of preservatives, additives, and other substances used in the manufacturing process is a critical factor. These additives could potentially alter the results observed in studies where only purified compounds of controlled origin were used. Investigations in this area are currently lacking, yet they could be exploited to elucidate the aforementioned controversies and the bridge between laboratory findings and clinical outcomes in real-world patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge &#8220;Victor Babes&#8221; University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara for their support in covering the cost of publication for this review paper.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
