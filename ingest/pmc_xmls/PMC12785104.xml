By optimising pharmacokinetics, refining tumour-selective drug delivery, and supporting high-resolution, multimodal imaging, nanomedicine offers a versatile platform to address these limitations. In this review, current progress across lipid-based, polymeric, inorganic, hybrid, and biomimetic nanocarriers is synthesised, emphasising how tailored physiochemical properties, surface functionalisation, and stimuli-responsive designs can improve tumour localisation, surmount stromal and ascetic barriers, and enable controlled drug release. Concurrently, significant advancement in imaging nanoprobes, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET)/single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), optical, near-infrared imaging (NIR), ultrasound, and photoacoustic systems, has evolved early lesion detection, intraoperative guidance, and quantitative monitoring of treatment. Diagnosis and therapy are further integrated within single platforms by emerging theranostic constructs, encouraging real-time visualisation of drug distribution and treatment response. Additionally, immune-nanomedicine, intraperitoneal depot systems, and nucleic acid-centred nanotherapies offer promising strategies to address immune suppression and molecular resistance in advanced ovarian cancer. In spite of noteworthy achievements, clinical translation is limited by complex manufacturing requirements, challenges with safety and stability, and restricted patient stratification. To unlock the full clinical potential of nanotechnology in ovarian cancer management, constant innovation in scalable design, regulatory standardisation, and integration of precision biomarkers will be necessary.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ovarian cancer nanomedicine</kwd><kwd>targeted drug delivery</kwd><kwd>multimodal imaging</kwd><kwd>theranostic nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>intraperitoneal nanotherapy</kwd><kwd>tumour microenvironment (TME) targeting</kwd><kwd>stimuli-responsive nanocarriers</kwd><kwd>theranostic therapeutic platforms</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-18-00086"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In 2020 ovarian cancer remained a high-mortality disease in Europe, with 39,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths reported, corresponding to an age-standardised incidence rate (ASR) of 15.5/100,000 and an ASR mortality of 10.3/100,000 [<xref rid="B1-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Declining mortality trends with a predicted ASR of 4.32 per 100,000 women in 2022, as estimated by subsequent population-based analysis across Europe [<xref rid="B2-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite these declines, updated estimates based on Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2022 data show the ovarian cancer burden in Europe to continue to be substantial, with continually high incidence and mortality rates compared to other regions [<xref rid="B3-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ovarian cancer is a primary target for nanomedicine strategies in imaging, targeting and therapy, as these high mortality rates reflect late-stage symptom presentation, with most cases diagnosed at International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III or IV. Peritoneal metastatic spread, typical of HGSOC, and treatment resistance also contribute to this elevated mortality rate [<xref rid="B4-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Biomarkers, such as CA-125 and human epididymis protein (HE4), showing low sensitivity and non-specific symptoms in the early stages of disease, remain the primary limitations of early detection of ovarian cancer, despite advances [<xref rid="B5-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The window for effective intervention is reduced, as this delay often leads to diagnosis at advanced stages. Around 70% of patients presenting with epithelial ovarian carcinoma relapse following first-line therapy, presenting recurrence to be exceedingly common [<xref rid="B6-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therapeutic effectiveness is concurrently undermined by drug resistance, mediated by mechanisms such as DNA damage repair changes, altered transmembrane drug transport, epigenetic modifications and signalling pathway dysregulation [<xref rid="B7-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These barriers pose direct challenges in the context of nanomedicine, as high-sensitivity targeted imaging and biomarker-loaded nanoprobes are demanded for early detection, while resistance and recurrence require nanocarriers that overcome residual disease niches and heterogeneity and are capable of overcoming efflux pumps. Crucial intervention points for imaging, targeting and therapeutic nanomedicine in ovarian cancer are highlighted by the triad of frequent relapse, chemoresistance and late detection [<xref rid="B8-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Cytoreductive surgery and platinum-taxane chemotherapy are relied on as the standard treatments of advanced ovarian cancer; although, microscopic peritoneal implants often fail to be completely removed during surgery, and residual disease remains an utmost source of relapse [<xref rid="B9-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The development of drug resistance mechanisms, for example, enhanced DNA repair or efflux pumps, in tumour cells, dose-limiting toxicities and non-specific biodistribution hinder systemic chemotherapy [<xref rid="B10-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nanoparticle-based platforms aim to utilise the therapeutic window for nanomedicine by combating these limitations. These platforms intend to penetrate residual microscopic disease, unreachable by standard chemo or surgery, improve tumour-specific delivery, and decrease off-target toxicity [<xref rid="B11-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Challenges such as tumour heterogeneity, abnormal peritoneal fluid dynamics, and integration into current surgical/chemotherapeutic workflows, nonetheless, need to be overcome for effective translation of nanomedicine.</p><p>The improvement of pharmacokinetics (PK), enabling targeted delivery, and adding real-time imaging are solutions offered by nanomedicine to overcome ovarian cancer&#8217;s therapeutic impediments. Reduced cardiotoxicity and sustained activity in relapsed disease can be achieved by pegylated liposomal encapsulation, exemplifying PK gains. Liposomal encapsulation: shrinks volume of distribution, boosts tumour exposure versus free drug and extends circulation half-life [<xref rid="B12-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although recognised limitations of pegylated liposomes, such as the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon in particular, counterbalance these benefits following repeated dosing. Additionally, rapid opsonisation and hepatic uptake, which can lead to reduced circulation time, reduced tumour accumulation, and unpredictable therapeutic performance, are promoted by the generation of anti-PEG IgM antibodies. Non-specific biodistribution and dose-limiting toxicity, inherent to conventional chemotherapy, can aim to be overcome by targeting moieties (e.g., peptides, antibodies, and folate derivatives) attached onto nanocarriers, which will concentrate the active compound at ovarian cancer cells or within their microenvironment [<xref rid="B13-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while imaging-capable nanoparticles allow earlier detection and surgical guidance, beyond delivery. Further, contrast-enhanced platforms for MRI, PET/SPECT, and optical/near-infrared (NIR) modalities, including intraoperative probes designed for peritoneal micrometastases, are catalogued in ovarian cancer-focused reviews [<xref rid="B14-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Intra-abdominal tumour visualisation during cytoreductive surgery can be illustrated with preclinical work with erythrocyte-derived NIR nano-constructs in support of the theragnostic concept &#8220;see and treat&#8221; [<xref rid="B15-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Together these advances address three needs: Drugs are kept in circulation and within tumours longer, optimising PK; intratumoral drug-to-healthy-tissue ratios are increased by molecular targeting; and disease is mapped, resection is guided, and response is monitored by longitudinal or real-time imaging. Although clinical translation is still hindered by heterogeneity and peritoneal transport barriers [<xref rid="B16-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], nanomedicine is positioned as a practical complement and, in certain scenarios, an enhancer to systemic chemotherapy and surgery due to the maturation of ovarian-specific nanoplatforms across delivery and diagnostic fronts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-cancers-18-00086"><title>2. Biological and Pathophysiological Context for Nanomedicine Delivery</title><sec id="sec2dot1-cancers-18-00086"><title>2.1. Tumour Microenvironment, Peritoneal Dissemination and Ascites</title><p>Formidable physical and biochemical barriers to nanomedicine delivery are imposed by the tumour microenvironment (TME) in ovarian cancer. Aberrant, leaky vasculature and inadequate perfusion cause regions of hypoxia that promote drug resistance and limit oxygen-dependent imaging probes by triggering hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF-1a)-mediated changes [<xref rid="B17-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Compressed lymphatics and abnormal vessel outflow elevate interstitial fluid pressure (IFP); the extravasation of nanoparticles into the tumour interstitium is further impeded by this, and rather than retention, convective clearance is favoured [<xref rid="B18-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Dense stromal architecture, which restricts nanoparticle diffusion and delays payload release, is a consequence of extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, as seen in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. This includes increased collagen deposition, hyaluronic acid accumulation and activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts [<xref rid="B19-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hypoxia, high IFP, and dense ECM must be addressed by nanomedicine design in ovarian cancer. This can be performed by enhancing tumour penetration, imaging contrast, and therapeutic efficiency through the integration of stimuli-responsive release, optimised carrier architecture, and stromal targeting features.</p><p>Effective nanomedicine delivery in advanced ovarian cancer is significantly obstructed by peritoneal dissemination and accumulation of malignant ascites. Nanoparticle residence time is reduced, and diffusion into implants is limited by convective clearance generated by tumour nodules bathed in ascitic fluid and seeded on peritoneal surfaces [<xref rid="B20-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nanoparticle attachment and retention on the peritoneal surface is impeded by the fluid-driven shear and movement of ascites. Furthermore, due to hepatic clearance and limited transport across serosal membranes, systemic intravenous delivery faces poor peritoneal penetration [<xref rid="B21-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, local concentration can be enhanced by the emergence of intraperitoneal administration of nanoparticles as a strategic route. Rapid drainage and nanoparticle clearance in ascitic fluid, even in this route, require design features such as prolonged retention, large tumoral surface binding, and size optimisation to improve uptake and therapeutic index in disseminated peritoneal disease [<xref rid="B22-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-cancers-18-00086"><title>2.2. Molecular Targets</title><p>Anchors for targeted nanomedicine in EOC are provided by several cell surface biomarkers that are frequently overexpressed. In high-grade serous disease, FOLR1 (FR-&#945;) is enriched, and folate-directed therapeutics and diagnostics are underpinned by it. Subtype distribution is quantified, and assay standardisation needs are highlighted in recent clinic-pathologic studies [<xref rid="B23-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While mesothelial adhesion and peritoneal dissemination are mediated by mesothelin (MSLN) binding MUC16/CA125, this is an axis widely leveraged for nanoparticle and antibody/nanobody targeting [<xref rid="B24-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further, epithelial tumour cells are marked by epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and it has been linked to prognosis and chemoresistance. EpCAM is used for EV-based readouts and surface functionalisation with targeting ligands or aptamers [<xref rid="B25-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The hyaluronan receptor, CD44, supports hyaluronic acid (HA)-based carriers or dual-target designs, whilst enriching stem-like subpopulations [<xref rid="B26-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Whereas RGD-guided imaging/therapy and intraperitoneal targeting in ovarian models are enabled by integrins (av&#946;3/av&#946;5) on tumours and antagonistic endothelium [<xref rid="B27-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as shown in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Although its prognostic value is heterogeneous, it is important to mention PD-L1 as a marker variably expressed in EOC. It plays a significant role in immuno-nanomedicine combinations and immune-responsive theranostics [<xref rid="B28-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Ligand selection, patient stratification, and payload placement are informed by these biomarkers for imaging, targeting, and therapeutic nanoplatforms in ovarian cancer. <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises the key molecular targets seen in ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-cancers-18-00086"><title>2.3. Routes of Administration</title><p>The exposure of peritoneal implants is crucially shaped by route selection. The standard route remains as intravenous (IV) therapy, although drug transfer to surface-embedded nodules is limited by the peritoneal plasma barrier and systemic clearance [<xref rid="B37-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as seen in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. After IV administration, typically only 0.1&#8211;2% of the injected nanomaterial dose accumulates in solid tumours, with noticeable inter-lesional variability. At the peritoneal surface, higher locoregional concentrations can be achieved by intraperitoneal (IP) delivery as a route of administration. IP delivery has also shown survival advantages in meta-analysis and randomised trials [<xref rid="B38-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Patient selection and supportive care are informed by common challenges, such as toxicity and abdominal discomfort, as shown by patient-reported outcomes from GOG-172 [<xref rid="B39-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is preferred in a surgical environment; following interval cytoreduction, HIPEC is shown to increase recurrence-free and overall survival in randomised trials. Data from long-term analysis also reinforces its strengths [<xref rid="B40-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In primary and certain recurrent diseases, a 2022 meta-analysis also shows HIPEC to be of benefit to patients, while heterogeneity is mentioned in indications and regimens [<xref rid="B41-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Long-circulating, stealth carriers with active targeting to reach peritoneal deposits are favoured for IV administration in nanomedicine. Contrastingly, designs that resist ascitic clearance and have the ability to remain stable in mild hyperthermia (41&#8211;43 degrees Celsius) are valued in IP/HIPEC [<xref rid="B42-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, peritoneal exposure and therapeutic index in ovarian cancer can be improved by prolonged half-life and tumour homing in IV administrative routes and increasing peritoneal surface adhesion, nanoparticle diameter optimisation and thermal stability in IP/HIPEC routes [<xref rid="B43-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-cancers-18-00086"><title>2.4. Clinical Relevance and Limitations of the EPR Effect in Humans</title><p>The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in humans is real but heterogenous: therefore, rather than being a reliable default, its effectiveness depends on patient-specific and lesion-specific biology, which includes vascular permeability, perfusion and stromal composition. Tumour uptake of nanomedicines has been confirmed by clinical imaging studies, but significant inter- and intra-individual variability is consistently observed [<xref rid="B44-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In patients, a 35-fold difference in liposome deposition across metastatic lesions, together with an association between higher deposition and more favourable outcomes, was quantified by PET/CT with <sup>64</sup>Cu-MM-302 (HER2-targeted pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), which supported the concept of image-guided patient selection [<xref rid="B45-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The extent of this variability is particularly relevant in ovarian cancer because the disease often presents with disseminated peritoneal implants showing heterogenous vascularisation and perfusion. Consequently, in poorly perfused lesions, EPR-only platforms may underperform, motivating the integration of active targeting, tumour microenvironment modulation, and theranostic data to personalise delivery strategies [<xref rid="B46-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this regard, nanomedicine strategies in ovarian cancer increasingly pair quantitative imaging modalities (PET/SPECT/MRI) with therapeutic payloads to map nanoparticle deposition, adjust dosing, and combine passive EPR with molecular ligands, such as folate or CD44, or stimuli-responsive release mechanisms [<xref rid="B47-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and in doing so, overall theranostic performance is significantly improved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-cancers-18-00086"><title>3. Nanocarrier Platforms and Engineering Design</title><p>In the context of ovarian cancer, nanocarrier engineering increasingly follows a translational logic in which design choices are evaluated for imaging compatibility, patient stratification, and clinical feasibility, in addition to delivery performance. Several recurring design principles, including particle size control, surface chemistry and stealthing, stimulus-responsive release, and targeting strategy, govern performance in ovarian cancer. While material composition dictates imaging or therapeutic modality compatibility, how these shared parameters are tuned to the peritoneal tumour microenvironment primarily determines translational success.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-cancers-18-00086"><title>3.1. Lipid-Based Systems</title><p>Polyethylene glycolated (PEGylated) liposomes increase circulation time, decrease cardiotoxicity, and are demonstrated in recurrent ovarian cancer. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), Doxil and Caelyx, showed improved results in platinum-sensitive disease, whilst exceeding topotecan&#8217;s effectiveness; PLD carboplatin is also considered an efficient treatment [<xref rid="B48-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Intravascular, hyperthermia-induced rapid release with image-guided dosing is enabled by thermosensitive liposomes; lessons acquired from translational research and empirical design guidelines for thermosensitive liposome development are provided in a well-established body of research [<xref rid="B49-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Nanocarriers are often manipulated with surface ligands to recognise and bind to molecular biomarkers; for example, folate ligands/antibodies are used to bind to folate receptor &#945; (FA&#945;), a characteristic ovarian cancer molecular marker. Peptides, such as arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) or aptamers, can be used to increase absorption and facilitate biomarker-guided patient selection [<xref rid="B50-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, biodistribution and response can be monitored during imaging by PET or NIR probes being co-loaded onto liposomes or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) [<xref rid="B51-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To intercede endosomal escape, ionisable lipids, helper phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids are used in LPNs for siRNA and mRNA. Whereas, in ovarian models, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)-based formulation, known as EPHARNA, successfully silenced the EphA2 gene and achieved antitumour activity; here local drug exposure can be maximised by IP administration [<xref rid="B52-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nanocarrier diameter, PEG surface density, TME activators (pH/redox) and administration route have been shown to marginally progress transport across ascites-rich peritoneal environments and to regulate the very variable EPR effect in ovarian cancer models. Although, it is important to mention that these strategies do not uniformly overcome ascites-associated transport barriers, and rather than decreasing EPR, EPR-mediated accumulation aims to be exploited by contemporary nanocarrier designs, where present, while integrating complementary mechanisms, such as intraperitoneal delivery, active targeting, or stimuli-responsive release, in order to account for its heterogenicity and limited reliability in advanced disease [<xref rid="B53-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-cancers-18-00086"><title>3.2.

The reason behind this hydrophilic requirement is because a steric and energetic barrier that reduces nonspecific protein absorption and protein corona formation develops when highly hydrated polymer layers bind water molecules. Hydrophilic coatings decrease rapid hepatic and splenic clearance by limiting opsonin binding and subsequent recognition by the mononuclear phagocyte system, and in doing so prolong circulation time and enhance tumour accumulation.

In a clinical example, solid tumours were treated with albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticles, known as Nab-paclitaxel; this demonstrated that consistent pharmacokinetics and enhanced safety can be achieved by a scalable production process in which nanoparticle size was controlled and albumin coating and reproducible drug loading were involved, therefore acting as a standard for clinical translatability in nanomedicine [<xref rid="B88-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].

Profound intratumoral penetration, ROS-mediated cell killing and US/PA dual imaging that can monitor treatment response ongoingly can be exhibited by dual US-activatable nanodroplets, intended for folate receptor-positive ovarian cancer [<xref rid="B137-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. In recent studies, nanoparticles integrated with olaparib have been modified for use as ultrasound contrast agents for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) proficient ovarian cancer, enabling integrated diagnosis and therapy by pairing PARP inhibitor delivery with contrast-enhanced ultrasound signals [<xref rid="B138-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. A complementary, completely organic PA platform, defined by strong NIR absorption, great photostability and readily achievable surface functionalisation for precise molecular targeting, can be provided by semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) [<xref rid="B139-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Strong contrast PA imaging and photoimmunotherapy in orthotopic and metastatic ovarian cancer models has recently been allowed by quinoidal SPNs with NIR-II absorption. This has led to the yielding of strong tumour suppression and inhibition of metastasis, while preserving a clear PA signal generated from deep pelvic lesions [<xref rid="B140-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. In tandem, dependable separation of exogenous signal from endogenous chromophores, which improved detectability of lesions and helped to guide following therapy, was enabled by a specific spectral signature PA nano-agent, engineered for ovarian cancer [<xref rid="B141-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. On the whole, activatable US/PA theranostic systems that can map, treat and vigorously monitor ovarian cancer can be established by acoustic nanodroplets and semiconducting polymer nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot5-cancers-18-00086"><title>5.5. Multimodal Imaging Nanoplatforms</title><p>Nanosystems designed to carry out two (dual-mode) or three (tri-mode) imaging capabilities within a single construct are called multimodal imaging nanoplatforms. They were developed with the intention of overcoming limitations of traditional imaging of small peritoneal lesions, such as poor sensitivity. Additionally, they were also engineered to incorporate high-resolution structural imaging outputs, like ultrasound (US), CT and MRI, with molecular or functional information that can be provided by imaging modalities such as PA, PET and fluorescence. In a recent review about ovarian cancer nanoparticle imaging agents, the tailoring of platforms for integration into standard imaging modalities, such as fluorescence, US, PA, PET/CT and MRI, is highlighted [<xref rid="B14-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Dual-mode anatomical-molecular imaging can be well exemplified by folate-targeted oxygen/indocyanine green lipid nanoparticles (FA-OINPs). By their implementation, both US and PA signals are enhanced in SKOV3 ovarian cancer xenografts, while under NIR laser and US irradiation, photo-sonodynamic and photothermal therapy are provided [<xref rid="B142-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. PET/CT for quantitative biodistribution and MR temperature imaging is enabled by copper sulphide nanoparticles tagged with <sup>64</sup>Cu. This facilitates real-time monitoring of photothermal therapy in HeyA8 and SKOV3-ip1 ovarian cancer models, combining PET-based molecular guidance with MR-based thermometry [<xref rid="B143-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. T1-weighted MRI, fluorescence (FL), and infrared thermal (IRT) imaging in SKOV3 models are provided by biodegradable hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoplatforms (HMON@CuS/Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). This enables FL/MRI/IRT-guided mild photothermal therapy that, without systemic toxicity, can destabilise lysosomes and suppress tumour growth [<xref rid="B144-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Phase transitional, folate-targeted perfluoropentane nanodroplets, payloaded with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (FA-HCPT-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-PFP NDs), achieved MRI and PA imaging. After low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulated liquid-to-gas transition, a strong ultrasound contrast was generated while concurrently releasing chemotherapeutic agents in mice bearing SKOV3 xenografts. This demonstrated true MRI/PA/US tri-mode theranostics [<xref rid="B145-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Lastly, MicroSPECT/CT-based multimodal imaging of SKOV3 xenografts is demonstrated by telodendrimer paclitaxel nanomicelles labelled with <sup>125</sup>I; this guides drug delivery by quantifying tumour-selective accumulation and pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="B146-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Collectively, these platforms show how integrated anatomical-molecular imaging in ovarian cancer nanomedicine encourages precise lesion detection, image-guided intervention, and real-time monitoring of nanotherapy effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot6-cancers-18-00086"><title>5.6. Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers</title><p>The unifying translational bridge across imaging modalities, enabling nanoparticle accumulation, retention, and therapeutic response to be compared independently of carrier composition, can be provided by quantitative imaging biomarkers. Quantitative imaging biomarkers can achieve this by delivering measurable parameters to track nanocarrier delivery and to foresee or monitor treatment response in ovarian cancer nanomedicine. Nanoparticle studies report increasing amounts of standardised parameters, such as K<sup>trans</sup> and V<sub>e</sub>, %ID/g and tumour-to-muscle ratios. A notable example is the quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI approach established by Nomani et al. In this study, a nano-sized MRI contrast agent was used in three ovarian cancer tumour xenograft models. Tumours were stratified for responsiveness to nanotherapeutics, and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was estimated non-invasively by derived permeability and retention parameters, such as K<sup>trans</sup> and V<sub>e</sub> [<xref rid="B147-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. In relation to PET-based molecular biomarkers, Yang et al. manufactured a <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-c(NGR)<sub>2</sub> probe, which targets CD13 in ovarian cancer xenografts. Tumour uptake as %ID/g and tumour-to-muscle ratios were quantified on microPET. PET-obtained uptake values could be recognised as biomarkers for targeted nanocarrier localisation and candidate therapy selection, due to these metrics correlating with CD13 expression and blocking experiments [<xref rid="B148-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Reviews of nanoparticle imaging in ovarian cancer, with a focus on clinical applications, such as by Di Lorenzo et al., describe how radiolabelled liposomes, iron-oxide nanoparticles, and optical nanoprobes have been used in imaging ovarian cancer across various platforms, such as MRI, PET/SPECT, and FL. They emphasise that the quantification of imaging parameters, such as variations in signal intensity, improvement of contrast, and detectability of lesions, which enables nanoparticle distribution monitoring, and the assessment of treatment effects over time, is enabled by these nanoparticle-based approaches [<xref rid="B149-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Combined tracking-response biomarkers are exemplified by theranostic radiolabelled liposomes. Serial SPECT/CT-derived pharmacokinetics have been connected to changes in tumour biology, involving drug resistance reversal and stemness markers, in ovarian cancer models and initial clinical work with <sup>188</sup>Re-liposome. This provided imaging-based metrics of nanotherapy effectiveness [<xref rid="B150-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Lastly, quantitative DCE-MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) parameters, which have already been authenticated for ovarian tumour characterisation, such as K<sup>trans</sup> and V<sub>e</sub>, are seen as easily translatable response biomarkers for future nanoparticle-based therapies in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="B151-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Notwithstanding notable advances, the clinical translation of theranostic nanomedicine in ovarian cancer continues to be restricted by several limitations. Effective intracellular drug delivery, release of the active therapeutic component, or therapeutic response does not always correlate with imaging-detected nanoparticle accumulation; this creates a central disconnect between signal detection and efficiency. Dose mismatches between tracer-level imaging agents and clinically meaningful drug exposure deepen this challenge, in addition to spatial and temporal discordance, in which imaging reflects early vascular deposition rather than sustained intratumoral retention. Further, the reliability of quantitative imaging biomarkers as predictors of therapeutic response is reduced by pronounced inter-lesional and inter-patient heterogeneity in nanoparticle delivery, retention and release. Lastly, manufacturing and regulatory challenges that restrict batch-to-batch reproducibility and standardisation of imaging signal are introduced by the structural complexity of multimodal theranostic platforms, limiting validation of quantitative biomarkers and clinical translation. <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> describes multimodal imaging nanoprobes used in ovarian cancer.</p><p>Aside from lesion detection, by enabling in vivo assessment of delivery, patient stratification, and treatment adaptation, quantitative and multimodal imaging serves as a translational bridge between nanocarrier design and clinical application.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-cancers-18-00086"><title>6.

Nucleic Acid Nanomedicine</title><p>The viability of siRNA nanotherapy in ovarian cancer was recognised by neutral nanoliposomes. Vigorous gene silencing decreased tumour growth, and increased paclitaxel efficiency in orthotopic models was produced by EphA2-targeting siRNA formulated in DOPC liposomes. This illustrated RNAi-mediated chemosensitisation [<xref rid="B152-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. miRNA nanomedicines build on this by aiming to reinstate tumour-suppressive networks.</p><p>In ovarian cancer models, the restored expression of miR-200c reduced the extent of metastasis and heightened sensitivity to paclitaxel.

Additionally, PARP modulation has become nano-enabled. A polymeric formulation of olaparib, called NanoOlaparib, was able to show effective intraperitoneal exposure and tumour control in disseminated peritoneal models, whilst sustaining activity similar to a free drug. This suggested a strategy to treat late-stage disease beyond BRCA-mutant subsets [<xref rid="B154-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Platinum resistance can be overcome by complementary multilayered liposomal nanoparticles co-loading cisplatin and a PARP inhibitor with an external hyaluronan coating for CD44; survival in HGSOC models was also improved [<xref rid="B155-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. A tumour-targeted liposomal system, delivering clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 plasmids known as CRISPR-enabled nanomedicine, is upcoming. Efficient gene editing and inhibition of growth in ovarian xenografts have been achieved by this system. This provides preclinical demonstration that nanoparticles that are non-viral can support in vivo genome editing for treatment of ovarian cancer [<xref rid="B156-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot2-cancers-18-00086"><title>6.2. Targeted Enzyme-Responsive Nanotherapies</title><p>Protease overexpression, redox imbalance, and hypoxia in ovarian tumours are made use of in enzyme- and microenvironment-responsive nanotherapies to attain spatially controlled drug activation. Selective enzymatic activation in cathepsin B-overexpressing SKOV3 and HeyA8 cells was shown by cathepsin B-specific doxorubicin prodrug nanoparticles, which were built from FRRG-DOX conjugates. Moreover, significantly improved intraperitoneal inhibition of tumour progression with decreased systemic toxicity, when compared to free doxorubicin in peritoneal carcinomatosis models, was also observed [<xref rid="B157-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. A complementary protease-activated platform is provided by matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3)-sensitive near-infrared fluorescent probes. MMP-3 stimulated signal intensification and allowed sensitive stromal imaging in an epithelial ovarian cancer xenograft. This demonstrates that MMP-responsive constructs can be adapted for image-guided nanotherapies [<xref rid="B158-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Elevated tumour GSH is exploited by redox-responsive systems. GSH-triggered platinum release, US-mediated enhancement of tumour uptake, and strong antitumour efficiency with weakened nephrotoxicity in SKOV3 models can be achieved by GSH-sensitive Pt (IV) prodrug-loaded phase-transitional nanoparticles with a hybrid lipid-polymer shell [<xref rid="B159-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Oxygen-poor peritoneal lesions are targeted by hypoxia-activated systems. A sphingomyelin cholesterol liposome, which encapsulated the vinblastine-N-oxide prodrug CPD100, called CPD100Li, showed more than a 9-fold increase in cytotoxicity in hypoxic conditions in ES2 ovarian cancer cells; hypoxia-activated liposomal chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer was further supported by satisfactory pharmacokinetics and tolerability in vivo [<xref rid="B160-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot3-cancers-18-00086"><title>6.3. Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy</title><p>Light-activated agents are used to convert optical energy into cytotoxic heat or ROS within ovarian tumours in photothermal and photodynamic nanotherapies. Laser irradiation parameters that have a substantial influence on the therapeutic outcome of photothermal and photodynamic nanotherapies include continuous wave versus pulsed operation, duration of pulse, irradiance, and total fluence. For sustained photothermal heating, continuous-wave NIR lasers are typically used, whereas higher peak power for rapid localised heating or enhanced photodynamic activation while reducing bulk tissue damage can be enabled by pulsed irradiation. To balance effective tumour ablation or ROS generation with minimised off-target thermal injury, careful control of irradiance and fluence is necessary. IR780 is an NIR dye that can act as both a fluorophore and photothermal transducer in folate-targeted liposomal formulations. Intraoperative delineation of tumour margins is enabled by FA-IR780 nanoparticles accumulated selectively in ovarian xenograft models, and following irradiation with an 808 nm laser, the surrounding tissue was spared whilst most lesions were eradicated [<xref rid="B161-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Local damage is further intensified by dual photothermal-photodynamic platforms; receptor-mediated uptake, strong singlet-oxygen generation and tumour elimination in ovarian cancer xenograft models, under irradiation of a single NIR laser, were demonstrated by folate-targeted Pluronic chitosan nanocapsules co-loaded with IR780 [<xref rid="B162-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Nanocarrier co-loading with clinically used photosensitisers can also advance photodynamic efficiency. Nanostructured lipid carriers with encapsulated verteporfin can enable prolonged circulation, efficient tumour accumulation and significant inhibition of tumour growth, compared to free verteporfin, while evading the severe phototoxic side effects that can be seen with the free drug [<xref rid="B163-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Further, PDT in an ovarian cancer ascites model was enhanced by hypocrellin-B-loaded poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles, which prolonged survival time compared to unconjugated drug [<xref rid="B164-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Despite this progress, limited penetration of NIR-I light through large tumour masses restrains efficiency, driving development of NIR-II phototheranostic polymers that can more deeply penetrate tissues and could lead to better signal-to-background ratios [<xref rid="B165-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot4-cancers-18-00086"><title>6.4. Immuno-Nanomedicine</title><p>The goal of immuno-nanomedicine is to transform the immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; ovarian TME, which is abundant in M2-polarised TAMs but lacks effector T cells, towards a state that promotes antitumour immunity [<xref rid="B166-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>,<xref rid="B167-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>].

Gautam et al. designed cowpea mosaic virus nanoparticles showing an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) peptide for immune checkpoint inhibition. Superior tumour control and survival were demonstrated, when compared to free peptide or unconjugated virus, in an ID8 intraperitoneal model. This exemplified that multivalent nanoparticle display can strengthen local PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition, whilst simultaneously limiting systemic exposure [<xref rid="B169-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Large anionic liposomes that migrate to peritoneal TAMs and deliver the toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist resiquimod were engineered by Kang et al. These liposomes were successful in reprogramming TAMs towards an M1 phenotype, increasing T cell infiltration, as seen in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, and markedly enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-1 treatment in syngeneic ovarian tumours [<xref rid="B168-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Checkpoint responses can be further amplified by antigen-directed nanovaccines. Cancer-erythrocyte hybrid membrane-camouflaged Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-ICG@IRM nanoparticles that accumulate in ID8 tumours were reported by Xiong et al. Immunogenic cell death, tumour antigen release and activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell mediated immunity were triggered by NIR photothermal irradiation, demonstrating robust primary tumour inhibition and resistance to tumour rechallenge [<xref rid="B170-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. The ovarian TME can be directly remodelled by macrophage repolarising nanotherapies. Peritoneal TAMs in an ID8-VEGF model were selectively targeted by hyaluronic acid/polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles encapsulating miR-125b. The TAMs were shifted to an immune-activating phenotype, and when combined with intraperitoneal paclitaxel, a reduction in ascites and VEGF levels was seen, with minimal systemic toxicity [<xref rid="B171-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>].

Intraperitoneal Nanotherapy</title><p>Direct exposure of disseminated ovarian implants to nanoparticle depots is used in IP therapy to progress peritoneal disease control while minimising systemic exposure. In comparison to traditional IP solutions, nanoparticle systems are designed to remain in the peritoneal cavity, adhere to serosal surfaces and release the drug slowly, maintaining cytotoxic levels along peritoneal tumour implants dispersed across tumour-bearing peritoneal surfaces [<xref rid="B172-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Following cytoreductive surgery, intraoperatively administered paclitaxel-loaded expansile nanoparticles notably decreased locoregional recurrence, and survival versus free paclitaxel in ovarian carcinoma models was improved. This demonstrated that intraperitoneally retained nanocarriers strengthen locoregional control of microscopic residual tumours [<xref rid="B173-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Radiolabelled expansile nanoparticles emphasise residence time advantages; after a single IP dose, they show tumour-selective accumulation within the peritoneal cavity lasting for up to 1&#8211;2 weeks, with negligible signal in distant organs [<xref rid="B128-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Likewise, a long-acting intraperitoneal depot was created by paclitaxel-loaded genipin-crosslinked gelatin microspheres.

High peritoneal-to-plasma gradients are the root of toxicity reduction.

Physicochemical Determinants of Nanoparticle Biodistribution and Clearance in Ovarian Cancer</title><p>Biodistribution and clearance in ovarian cancer nanomedicine are dictated by nanoparticle physicochemical properties. In pharmacokinetic studies, extremely small particles, with a diameter of less than 10 nm, are shown to be rapidly cleared renally, while filtration is avoided by systems with particles of a diameter of 10&#8211;100 nm, although they are still small enough to cross the vascular border and accumulate in tumours. Nanoparticles with a diameter larger than 200 nm are mostly captured by Kupffer cells in the liver and spleen [<xref rid="B177-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>,<xref rid="B178-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. He et al. showed that size and surface charge act together when he found that tumour uptake is maximised by nanoparticles of 150 nm diameter with a mildly negative zeta potential, while improved opsonisation and reticuloendothelial clearance can be achieved by strongly cationic or highly anionic formulations [<xref rid="B179-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Migration, tumour penetration, and cellular internalisation are further moderated by shape, with extended circulation and altered organ tropism, compared with spheres, being exhibited with rod-like or discoidal geometries [<xref rid="B180-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. An additional bio-interface is introduced by malignant ascites in the peritoneal cavity. It is shown that ovarian cancer ascites is abundant in albumin, complement, coagulation factors and tumour-associated proteins like CA125/MUC16, by proteomic profiling, forming a complex biochemical environment for nanoparticle absorption [<xref rid="B181-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>,<xref rid="B182-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. Nanoparticles quickly obtain an ascites-specific protein corona, as seen in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, upon IP administration. It was established by Dakwar et al. that widespread aggregation in peritoneal and ascitic fluid can be seen by non-PEGylated cationic and anionic particles, while colloidal stability can be enhanced by PEGylation, although it can also lead to premature release of siRNA, which can reshape local pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="B183-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Protein corona composition, as a result, controls recognition by macrophages, complement and NK cells, modulating immune clearance and tumour versus off-target uptake [<xref rid="B184-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Therefore, ovarian cancer nanomedicines that prospered in vivo combine diameter (50&#8211;150 nm), an almost neutral or slightly negative charge, and stealth coatings with tumour-specific ligands to navigate ascites, make use of helpful coronas, and successfully achieve selective imaging and therapy [<xref rid="B14-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B185-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec7dot2-cancers-18-00086"><title>7.2. Toxicity, Immunogenicity, and Reporting Standards in Ovarian Cancer Nanomedicine</title><p>A key part of translating ovarian cancer nanomedicine into the clinic is analysis of acute and chronic safety profiles. Nanoformulation can shift toxicity from acute cardiomyopathy to infusion reactions, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and mucositis, whilst significantly decreasing early-onset heart failure when compared to traditional doxorubicin, as shown in clinical experience with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) [<xref rid="B186-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. However, safety considerations that become more significant with repeated dosing and long-term exposure are introduced by the altered biodistribution and prolonged circulation that underlie these clinical benefits. For instance, it is indicated by long-term follow-ups that at very high lifetime doses, cumulative cardiotoxicity remains a concern, although if cardiac risk factors and function are monitored carefully, PLD can frequently be given without a strict upper limit [<xref rid="B187-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Past organ toxicity, immunogenicity can be triggered by nanomedicines. Nano-specific adverse events like complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) and other infusion reactions that are more frequent with certain liposomal and micellar products than with their standard formulations can be revealed by pharmacovigilance data. For nanomedicine-based products that are intended for use in oncology, including ovarian cancer regimens, structured in vitro and in vivo assessments of cytokine release, complement activation, hypersensitivity and unintended immune suppression or stimulation are advised by immunotoxicology guidelines [<xref rid="B188-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Highly important for younger patients is reproductive toxicity, though it is poorly characterised. It is shown by experimental and epidemiological analyses that various nanoparticles can cross placental and blood-testis barriers, disturb spermatogenesis by accumulating in gonads, and disrupt folliculogenesis and embryo development through oxidative stress and DNA damage, therefore supporting rigorous pregnancy exclusion, contraception counselling and prudent dose translation from preclinical models to ovarian cancer trials [<xref rid="B189-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Though, commonly used preclinical models often fail to capture the fibrotic, heterogenous, and ascites-rich peritoneal environment that has a critical influence on nanoparticle biodistribution, toxicity, and therapeutic response in patients, limiting their predictive value. Vital for interpreting these risks and their translational relevance is high-quality reporting. The MIRIBEL checklist outlines minimum information for bio-nanomaterial experiments so that toxicity and efficiency in ovarian cancer models can be reproduced and compared. It requires detailed nanoparticle physicochemical characterisation, describing size, charge, corona and stability, dosimetry, biological models and statistics [<xref rid="B190-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>].

In refractory disease, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) has shown notable standalone activity [<xref rid="B196-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>], and due to reports from phase I studies showing advantageous pharmacokinetics and controllable dose-limiting toxicities, as seen in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, it is being repositioned for intraperitoneal or aerosolised delivery (PIPAC) in peritoneal metastases [<xref rid="B197-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>,<xref rid="B198-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Clinical translation of siRNA nanomedicine is at earlier stages of advancement. Though ongoing preclinical evaluation is supported by DOPC-based EphA2-siRNA liposomes (EPHARNA) completing good laboratory practice (GLP) safety studies in mice and other non-human primates [<xref rid="B199-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Vigorous prolongation of survival in orthotopic models, but no late-phase human data yet, is shown by multiple lipid and hybrid LNP platforms, which target PLK1/elF3c, Parp1 or CD44 positive cells [<xref rid="B200-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>,<xref rid="B201-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Instead of radically transforming outcomes, generally, nanomedicines modestly prolong progression-free survival and improve tolerability. A lack of prospective stratification by target expression, such as FOLR1, EphA2 and CD44, along with integration of companion imaging or biopsies being limited, leads to &#8216;nanotargets&#8217; being rarely used to select patients for specific nanomedicine treatments; this signifies a central limitation and represents an area of improvement in upcoming ovarian cancer nanomedicine trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec8dot2-cancers-18-00086"><title>8.2. Manufacturing, Stability and Regulatory Requirements for Ovarian Cancer Nanomedicines</title><p>Strict chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) information is required for manufacturing nanomedicines for ovarian cancer. Tight control of significant quality attributes, such as size, polydispersity and surface charge, is required for complex structures such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles and micelles, to guarantee reproducibility between batches and foreseeable pharmacokinetics, as stated in reviews of translational applications of nanomedicine [<xref rid="B202-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Small differences in mixing, exchange of solvents or lyophilisation can change ovarian cancer formulations such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [<xref rid="B203-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>] or nanocomplexes loaded with cisplatin [<xref rid="B204-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. Parenteral nanomedicines have to be sterile; however, destabilisation of nanocarriers may occur through thermal or radiation sterilisation. Consequently, cost is often increased by aseptic processing and sterile filtration being required, which demands robust stability profiles over storage and after reconstitution [<xref rid="B205-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. Aggregation, drug leakage and matrix oxidation are features of long-term physiochemical stability that hinder ovarian cancer nanoformulations from entering clinical trials [<xref rid="B206-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Together with complex analytics, these CMC and stability requirements raise manufacturing costs, which limit access regardless of clinical benefit in recurrent disease [<xref rid="B207-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Furthermore, the clinical progression of complex, multi-element nanomedicines is significantly limited by these constraints, as reliable, reproducible nano-formulations with well-defined critical quality attributes are favoured for large-scale production and regulatory approval. Ovarian nanomedicine regulatory frameworks build on general drug regulations but also include specific FDA and EMA expectations for nanomedicines. The need for thorough characterisation, risk-based EMC strategies and post-marketing surveillance is emphasised by FDA- and EMA-focused reviews, which reference nanotechnology guidance and EMA position papers on liposomes and other nanoproducts [<xref rid="B208-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Regulators are more frequently expecting co-validation of imaging or soluble biomarkers, like CA-125 and emerging multiplex panels, for theranostic ovarian platforms [<xref rid="B209-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>], evaluated in conjunction with the nanomedicine consistent with the broader shift toward imaging-based companion diagnostics and biomarker-guided theranostics in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="B210-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> summarises the clinical translation of ovarian cancer nanomedicines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9-cancers-18-00086"><title>9. Future Perspectives and Challenges</title><p>The integration of multi-omics profiling, such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, with AI-based modelling is being increasingly relied on in ovarian cancer precision nanomedicine to stratify patients, predict drug response and direct nanocarrier design. Signatures associated with early detection and prognosis of ovarian cancer can be identified through AI frameworks trained on molecular and imaging biomarkers, although their clinical use is hindered by small, heterogenous datasets and a lack of standardised image and omics workflows [<xref rid="B211-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. In theory, these models could be coupled to nanoparticle libraries, and based on individual tumour profiles and longitudinal radiomics data, tailored ligand combinations, payloads and dosing schedules could be selected for each patient. At the centre of &#8220;imaging-targeting-therapy&#8221; concepts in ovarian cancer are multifunctional theranostic platforms; for example, a comprehensive review about imaging and therapy of ovarian cancer: Clinical applications of nanoparticles describe that nanotheranostic nanoparticles, which integrate imaging and drug delivery, function in a single formulation and successfully monitor drug distribution profiles and pathological processes longitudinally in ovarian cancer patients, thus offering a promising approach for diagnostics and therapy [<xref rid="B149-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. For instance, CA125-targeted radiolabelled antibodies, folate-decorated liposomes and photodynamic nanoparticles for ovarian cancer. Plasmodic and exosome-based sensors are examples of emerging nanotechnologies for early detection that are being adapted to recognise proteins specific to ovarian cancer and nucleic acids in blood, urine or ascites [<xref rid="B212-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Due to HGSOC being &#8220;immune cold&#8221;, TME and immune modulation have developed into essential design criteria for nanomedicine. Kaur et al. describe nanoparticles that reprogram TAMs, deliver TLR agonists like resiquimod to peritoneal TAMs, boost infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and synergise with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade [<xref rid="B213-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. Comparable future strategies also apply to cytokine-loaded platforms, such as IL-12 nanoparticles, and redox- or pH-sensitive micelles that exploit hypoxia, acidosis or high GSH levels in the peritoneal cavity to stimulate localised drug release and turn &#8220;cold&#8221; lesions into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones, as seen in <xref rid="cancers-18-00086-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>. Balanced adjustment of size, charge and stiffness to favour intraperitoneal retention and stromal penetration is highlighted in reviews of TME-responsive nanomedicines [<xref rid="B214-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>,<xref rid="B215-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>].</p><p>However, clinical translation is slowed down by inconsistent regulatory frameworks and non-standardised datasets. Overall, in nanomedicine, the lack of reliable definitions, incomplete physiochemical characterisation and unpredictable safety endpoints across authorities are highlighted by regulators [<xref rid="B216-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. Coordinated international standards bodies and the European Medicines Agency (ISO/CEN-EMA) efforts, common test panels for nanoparticle identity, stability and interoperable data formats which link preclinical, imaging and clinical outcome data, are called for in a proposed standardisation roadmap [<xref rid="B217-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Simultaneously, before AI-based decision tools for ovarian cancer can guide regulatory-grade precision nanotherapy, they must meet developing requirements for transparency, bias control and external validation [<xref rid="B211-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>].</p><p>Ovarian cancer nanomedicine could be redesigned by several emerging technologies. Scalable, exosome-like carriers with inherent tumour tropism can be offered by immune cell-derived exosome mimetics (IDEM), which can deliver small RNAs or drugs to resistant cells in ovarian models and could overcome some manufacturing obstacles of natural exosomes [<xref rid="B218-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. Enzyme- and pH-responsive platforms for drug and immunomodulator delivery can be demonstrated by self-assembling peptide nanostructures that can also be used as 3D matrices that replicate the multicellular ovarian TME for screening nanotherapeutics [<xref rid="B219-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. Lastly, strong imaging contrast or photothermal properties with tuneable clearance are combined by biodegradable metallic nanocarriers, such as gold or zinc oxide systems, which are engineered for controlled dissolution. This signifies a promising direction for safer theranostic platforms in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="B220-cancers-18-00086" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec10-cancers-18-00086"><title>10. Conclusions</title><p>The diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of ovarian cancer is being rapidly reshaped by nanomedicine, presenting practical solutions to persistent challenges such as late detection, drug resistance, peritoneal dissemination, and dose-limiting toxicity. Nanoparticles reliably demonstrate the ability to improve drug pharmacokinetics, advance tumour-selective delivery, and facilitate high-resolution multimodal imaging across lipid-based, polymeric, inorganic, hybrid, and biomimetic platforms, which together form the basis of highly precise and adaptive ovarian cancer care. Notably, nanocarriers are progressively designed to navigate the ovarian TME and its biological complexities, such as hypoxia, dense ECM, ascites and expression of heterogenous receptors, by which the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy was historically hindered. Innovative nanomedicines achieve deeper tumour penetration, maintain stable intraperitoneal residence, and reduce systemic toxicity by integrating targeting ligands, stimuli-sensitive release designs and stealth strategies, thus widening the therapeutic window against advanced ovarian cancer.</p><p>A particularly transformative development is represented by theranostic platforms. Clinicians can visualise tumour load, guide surgical resection, and track treatment response in real time by uniting imaging and therapy into a single platform, such as MRI-trackable liposomes, radiolabelled polymeric particles and photoacoustic-sensitive nanodroplets. As peritoneal implants are often microscopic, widely disseminated and hard to detect with standard imaging, these capabilities address a critical need in ovarian cancer that is addressed by theranostic platforms.</p><p>Although clear progress has been made, clinical translation is still limited. Based on the evidence synthesised in this review, in order to accelerate clinical translation, several priorities must be addressed. A primary priority is the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from targeted or theranostic nanomedicines using molecular imaging and companion diagnostics by emphasising biomarker-guided patient stratification in future research. A further priority is to allow personalised dosing, early response assessment, and adaptive treatment strategies by expanding the integration of quantitative imaging biomarkers into nanomedicine development. An additional priority is to place greater focus on intraperitoneal delivery systems and ascites-resistant designs, which remain under-represented in clinical trials although they are uniquely suited to the dissemination pattern of ovarian cancer. A further priority is to advance the standardisation of nanocarrier characterisation, scalable manufacturing processes, and regulatory alignment in order to improve reproducibility and enable regulatory approval. Lastly, a promising direction to overcome chemoresistance and immune suppression in advanced disease is represented by integrating immunotherapy, gene-based approaches and stimuli-responsive platforms. Complementary advances in immunonanomedicine further support this strategy by aiding TAM reprogramming, improving T-cell infiltration and promoting synergistic checkpoint blockade in immune-cold HGSOC.</p><p>To conclude, the future impact of nanomedicine in ovarian cancer will rely not only on ongoing material and engineering innovation but also greatly on strategic integration with molecular profiling, quantitative imaging, and clinically relevant delivery routes. In order to translate nanotechnology from experimental platforms into operative, patient-centred solutions for ovarian cancer management, addressing these challenges will be essential.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
