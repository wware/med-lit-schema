Despite advancements in early screening and therapeutic interventions, the outcomes of patients with advanced-stage CRC remain suboptimal, as these patients continue to exhibit a persistently low 5-year survival rate. Palliative radiotherapy (RT) is crucial for advanced CRC patients, but radioresistance remains a significant clinical challenge. This resistance is attributed to multiple mechanisms, such as genetic heterogeneity, dysregulated DNA damage repair and tumor microenvironment metabolic disorders. Recent studies have shown that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), mainly microRNAs, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs, play pivotal roles in regulating CRC radiosensitivity through diverse mechanisms, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, epigenetic reprogramming, posttranscriptional regulation and oncogenic signaling pathway activation. For example, microRNAs such as miR-141-3p and miR-630 enhance CRC radiosensitivity by targeting oncogenic pathways. In addition, lncRNAs, including the lncRNAs HOTAIR and LINC00630, influence the radiosensitivity of CRC through interactions with the DNA damage repair machinery and epigenetic modulators, respectively. In addition, circ_0124554 acts as a competitive endogenous RNA to regulate oncogenic signaling. ncRNAs also serve as potential biomarkers for predicting radiosensitivity and prognosis. This review synthesizes the current evidence on the ncRNA-mediated regulatory networks that influence CRC radiosensitivity, emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets to overcome RT resistance and improve outcomes in advanced CRC. By bridging mechanistic insights with clinical applications, this work aims to guide future research and the implementation of precision RT strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Radiosensitivity</kwd><kwd>Noncoding RNAs</kwd><kwd>Colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Radioresistance</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>
<bold>Core Tip:</bold> Colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, shows less than 10% 5-year survival in advanced stages and radiotherapy is crucial for advanced CRC patients. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs, long ncRNAs and circular RNAs, significantly influence CRC radiosensitivity through diverse mechanisms like epithelial-mesenchymal transition, epigenetic reprogramming, post-transcriptional regulation and oncogenic signaling pathways activation. They show promise as biomarkers for predicting radiosensitivity and prognosis, and as therapeutic targets to overcome radioresistance. Targeting ncRNA-mediated networks offers promising strategies to overcome radioresistance and improve outcomes, bridging molecular mechanisms with precision radiotherapy for advanced CRC.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most diagnosed malignancy globally, with more than 1.92 million (9.6%) new cases and 903859 (9.3%) deaths reported in 2022, making it the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Advanced CRC has a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 10% for metastatic cases compared with 90% for localized disease[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Palliative radiotherapy (RT) constitutes a clinically validated intervention for patients with advanced CRC, demonstrating efficacy in achieving locoregional tumor control and mitigating disease-associated complications, including obstructive syndromes, hemorrhagic events, and refractory pain[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, poor sensitivity to RT remains a critical barrier in the clinical management of CRC, with up to 30% of patients developing tumor recurrence due to intrinsic or acquired radioresistance, which is driven by genetic heterogeneity, dysregulation of DNA repair capacity, cell cycle regulation, and tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a diverse class of functionally active RNA molecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). These molecules orchestrate epigenetic reprogramming, signal transduction modulation, and posttranscriptional gene regulation[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Emerging evidence indicates that ncRNAs act as pivotal regulators of CRC radiosensitivity by controlling genomic stability maintenance, DNA damage repair (DDR), and cell cycle arrest[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, miRNAs regulate key oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathways, which interact with radiation-induced DNA damage responses, ultimately determining CRC radiosensitivity[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, high LINC00630 expression in CRC not only correlates with radioresistance and poor prognosis but also directly drives therapeutic resistance. Knockdown of LINC00630 expression significantly increases CRC cell susceptibility to irradiation[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, circ-MFN2 promotes CRC radioresistance, proliferation, and metastasis by regulating the miR-574-3p/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) axis[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this article, we review the ncRNA-mediated mechanisms that regulate radiosensitivity and propose potential clinical targets to improve the prognosis of advanced CRC.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNCTIONS AND ROLES OF NCRNAS</title><p>On the basis of their structure and regulatory function, ncRNAs can be categorized into three main groups: LncRNAs (&gt; 200 nt), miRNAs (18-22 nt), and circRNAs (covalently closed loops)[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. MiRNAs bind to complementary sequences in the 3&#8217;-untranslated region of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. For example, miR-21 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Crohn&#8217;s disease-associated intestinal fibrosis <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/mTOR axis[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. LncRNAs can directly interact with the promoter regions of neighboring genes to modulate their transcriptional activity. Additionally, lncRNAs participate in posttranscriptional regulation by interacting with histone proteins, thereby altering the structure and state of chromatin[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. CircRNAs play dual functional roles, acting as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or scaffolds for RNA-protein interactions. Their circular structure confers resistance to RNA exonucleases, enhancing their stability[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. NcRNAs play important roles in cancer progression by regulating the TME, including immune regulation, signaling pathway regulation, and metabolic regulation[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For example, a myeloid-specific lncRNA from tumor-associated macrophages promotes aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In CRC, ncRNAs drive proliferation and metastasis through EMT and epigenetic dysregulation[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Specifically, lncRNA H19 induces EMT in CRC cells <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the miR-29b-3p/progranulin/Wnt axis, facilitating metastasis[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, ncRNAs influence chemotherapeutic sensitivity by targeting drug resistance genes, positioning them as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets[<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, circRNA Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 (circPDIA3) interacts with the gasdermin E-C domain to enhance its autoinhibitory effect, thus suppressing pyroptosis. A positive feedback loop involving the circPDIA3/miR-449a/X-box binding protein 1 axis increases circPDIA3 expression, promoting chemoresistance[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These ncRNA-driven mechanisms underscore the dual utility of ncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CRC. The role of ncRNAs in the occurrence and development of CRC has been systematically reviewed. In the following, we will mainly focus on the potential RT sensitization or resistance mechanisms of ncRNAs in the context of RT, and conduct a systematic review.</p></sec><sec><title>MOLECULAR MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR RADIOSENSITIVITY IN CRC</title><sec><title>DDR pathways</title><p>RT exerts its cytotoxic effects primarily by inducing DNA double-strand breaks, which are repaired through two major pathways: Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)[<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. NHEJ operates throughout all cell cycle phases and is associated with high repair efficiency; however, it is prone to error, potentially exacerbating genomic instability[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Functional defects in NHEJ-associated genes (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ku70</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Ku80</italic> and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit), such as Ku70 protein depletion, markedly increase cellular radiosensitivity[<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. HR, a precise double-strand break repair mechanism active during the S and G2 phases, utilizes an intact sister chromatid as a template to restore DNA breaks with high fidelity, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutagenesis[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Notably, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> mutations impair HR by disrupting RAD51-mediated DNA strand pairing, significantly increasing tumor cell sensitivity to RT[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In conclusion, compromised DNA repair machinery results in heightened vulnerability of tumors to radiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction-oxidation homeostasis regulation</title><p>Reduction-oxidation homeostasis plays a critical role in CRC radiosensitivity through the orchestration of metabolic adaptation and oxidative stress responses. Targeting these pathways may improve RT efficacy, as a dysregulated reduction-oxidation balance affects tumor radiosensitivity[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Tumor protein 53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator suppresses glycolysis by reducing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels and diverting glucose flux toward nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate synthesis. This mechanism mitigates radiation-induced oxidative stress in tumors, as observed in gliomas[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therapeutic targeting of tumor protein 53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator disrupts metabolic reprogramming, increases reactive oxygen species accumulation, and amplifies DNA damage during RT, thereby enabling tumor radiosensitization[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor receptor activation triggers Src family Fyn kinase-mediated tyrosine 481 phosphorylation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. This modification potentiates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate binding to increase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity, which reduces reactive oxygen species levels, accelerates DNA replication, and decreases tumor radiosensitivity[<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cycle checkpoints</title><p>The cell cycle is closely linked to tumor radiosensitivity, and the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation varies markedly across distinct cell cycle phases[<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. RT activates DNA damage checkpoints, inducing multiphase cell cycle arrest (G1/S, S, and G2/M) to enable DNA repair or initiate apoptosis[<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Key molecular pathways regulating the cell cycle include p53, cyclin G1, and checkpoint kinases 1/2, which coordinate checkpoint activation and repair mechanisms[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The tumor suppressor p53 critically enhances radiosensitivity at the G1/S checkpoint by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby preventing damaged cells from progressing through replication[<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Silencing cyclin G1 disrupts cell cycle progression and amplifies DNA damage accumulation, significantly increasing hepatocellular carcinoma radiosensitivity in preclinical models[<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Oncogene and tumor suppressor gene networks</title><p>Oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene networks regulate tumor radiosensitivity through EMT induction, which promotes therapeutic resistance[<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The oncogene <italic toggle="yes">NRP1</italic> promotes radiation-induced EMT in lung adenocarcinoma <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the transforming growth factor-&#946;1/Smad2/3 signaling axis, upregulating critical EMT transcription factors such as SNAIL and TWIST[<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 expression activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which suppresses DDR mechanisms and reduces tumor radiosensitivity, promoting resistance to RT[<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 enhances RT efficacy by restoring DNA repair capacity and overcoming PI3K/AKT/mTOR-driven resistance. Loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors, such as PTEN, disrupt apoptosis and differentiation pathways while simultaneously activating EMT programs that confer cancer stem-like properties and radiation resistance[<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This dual regulatory role highlights EMT as a pivotal mechanism linking oncogenic signaling, tumor plasticity, and therapeutic resistance in radiation oncology.</p></sec><sec><title>Epigenetic regulation</title><p>Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, dynamically regulate the transcriptional activity of oncogenes (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic>) and tumor suppressor genes (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, tumor protein 53), thereby modulating tumor radiosensitivity. The RNA methyltransferase NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 6 catalyzes m5C modifications on N-myc downstream regulates gene-1 mRNA, stabilizing its transcript to suppress apoptosis and confer radioresistance in cervical cancer models[<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In non-small cell lung cancer, MED13 L physically interacts with the histone acetyltransferase P300 to mediate chromatin remodeling. MED13 L knockdown diminishes P300 chromatin recruitment, attenuating genome-wide histone H3 on lysine 27 acetylation signaling and impairing P300-dependent acetylation. This epigenetic rewiring suppresses oncogene transcription (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, epidermal growth factor receptor) and sensitizes tumors to RT[<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ROLES OF NCRNAS IN THE REGULATION OF CRC RADIOSENSITIVITY</title><sec><title>Roles of miRNAs in the regulation of CRC radiosensitivity</title><p>Accumulating evidence highlights the critical role of miRNAs in modulating the radiosensitivity of CRC, with numerous miRNAs acting as tumor suppressors to sensitize tumors to RT (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For instance, miR-141-3p directly targets the oncogenic lncRNA distal-less homeobox 6 antisense 1. As reported previously, distal-less homeobox 6 antisense 1 is a lncRNA featuring an oncogene[<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Destabilizing its structure and promoting its degradation results in increased CRC radiosensitivity through the suppression of pro-survival signaling pathways[<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. MiR-630, which is regulated by cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, increases radiosensitivity by targeting BCL2-like 2, an antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member, and TP53 regulating kinase, a p53-regulating kinase, thereby impairing DNA repair and promoting apoptosis[<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Samadi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] reported that increased let-7e expression levels are associated with reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor protein levels, resulting in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. MiR-31 binds to the 3&#8217;-untranslated region of serine threonine kinase 40, a negative regulator of nuclear factor-&#954;B signaling, to increase radiation-induced apoptosis and suppress tumor growth[<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. MiR-124 is expressed at low expression levels in CRC cell lines and clinical CRC tissues and increases the radiosensitivity of CRC by targeting paired-related homeobox 1[<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In addition, miR-378a-5p, which is associated with radioresistance when expressed at low levels in CRC, increases radiosensitivity by targeting low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 8, a component of the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting prosurvival pathways[<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These miRNAs collectively contribute to the modulation of CRC radiosensitivity, representing potential therapeutic targets for improving treatment outcomes.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Several microRNAs involved in radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported that miR-183-5p suppresses the expression of the autophagy-related gene autophagy related 5, impairing radiation-induced autophagic cell death and correlating with poor prognosis. High miR-622 expression levels are sustained after RT, promoting radioresistance by enhancing DNA repair and survival pathways, and miR-622 overexpression is linked to aggressive CRC phenotypes[<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Exosomal miR-93-5p, which is secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts, downregulates the tumor suppressor forkhead box protein A1 while upregulating the expression of the pro-EMT factor transforming growth factor-&#946;3, thereby promoting proliferation and reducing apoptosis[<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similarly, exosomal miR-19b activates the Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathway by targeting negative regulators and promoting cancer stemness and radioresistance, and high miR-19b expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes[<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported that miR-106b increases tumor-initiating cell capacity and radioresistance <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway and suppression of the cell cycle inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21). Additionally, miR-29a directly binds to PTEN mRNA, downregulating its expression and activating PI3K/AKT signaling to drive survival and radioresistance[<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Finally, miR-222 amplifies PI3K/AKT signaling by suppressing PTEN, thereby reducing radiation-induced apoptosis and exacerbating therapeutic resistance[<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These oncogenic miRNAs are involved in critical pathways that could be targeted to overcome radioresistance in CRC.</p><p>Additionally, miRNAs exemplify the critical interplay between epigenetic regulation and the DDR machinery in modulating therapeutic responses. MiR-4274 and miR-130a play pivotal roles in regulating DDR and radiosensitivity in CRC. The deletion polymorphism rs1553867776 in miR-4274 downregulates the expression of peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5, a peroxisomal biogenesis factor that interacts with Ku70 to maintain genomic stability. Reduced peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 levels impair DDR by disrupting Ku70-mediated DNA repair, thereby increasing CRC radiosensitivity. Moreover, miR-130a acts as a potent radiosensitizer by suppressing DDR through multiple prosurvival pathways, including those involved in oxidative stress resistance and antiapoptotic signaling[<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Notably, miRNAs also drive EMT and TME reprogramming. MiR-130a, mentioned above, reverses EMT in CRC and subsequently inhibits cell invasion capacity after RT[<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similarly, miR-124 directly targets paired-related homeobox 1, a transcription factor that promotes EMT, to regulate CRC radiosensitivity[<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. MiR-1226-5p, which is upregulated in radioresistant CRC cells (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, HCT116), promotes EMT by suppressing interferon regulatory factor 1, leading to increased expression of EMT markers (TWIST, SNAIL, and N-cadherin) and enhanced invasion. The circRNA circSLC43A1 acts as a sponge to sequester miR-1226-5p and thus represents a therapeutic target to counteract the effects of miR-1226-5p[<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In summary, miRNAs have complex and diverse mechanisms of action in the regulation of CRC radiosensitivity and are expected to be potential therapeutic targets to improve the effect of RT in CRC.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of lncRNAs in the regulation of CRC radiosensitivity</title><p>Emerging evidence highlights the critical roles of lncRNAs in regulating CRC radiosensitivity through diverse molecular mechanisms (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

HOX antisense intergenic RNA is a lncRNA, and its expression is significantly upregulated in a variety of cancers and is associated with poor prognosis[<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>-<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similarly, HOX antisense intergenic RNA, which is overexpressed in CRC, drives radioresistance by stabilizing the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related protein-ATR-interacting protein complex to sustain DDR and by sponging miR-93 to upregulate the expression of the autophagy-related protein autophagy-related protein 12[<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>-<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Another lncRNA, MALAT1, forms a feedback loop with ankyrin repeat and KH domain containing 1 (ANKHD1) and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) to amplify YAP1/AKT-mediated DDR, promoting therapeutic resistance[<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. As reported previously, the expression of ANKHD1, an oncogene, is upregulated in CRC and is correlated with YAP1 expression, and knockdown of ANKHD1 increases radiosensitivity in CRC, impairing DDR[<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Several long noncoding RNAs involved in radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

These findings collectively indicate that lncRNAs are pivotal regulators of the response of CRC to radiation and offer promising therapeutic targets to overcome treatment resistance through the modulation of DDR, miRNA networks, epigenetic reprogramming, and critical signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of circRNAs in the regulation of CRC radiosensitivity</title><p>CircRNAs also play crucial roles in modulating CRC radiosensitivity through miRNA sponging and oncogenic signaling (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of ncRNAs in predicting CRC RT efficacy and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>NcRNAs as novel potential RT targets for CRC</title><p>Zhu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] demonstrated that miR-145 suppresses stemness-associated transcription factors (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, octamer binding transcription factor 4) and EMT, positioning it as a dual regulator of pluripotency and metastatic reprogramming. The overexpression of miR-145 increases CRC radiosensitivity by inhibiting the expression of snail family transcriptional repressor 1, a key EMT driver, suggesting that the snail family transcriptional repressor 1/miR-145 axis is a therapeutic target to reverse radioresistance through the concurrent suppression of EMT and cancer stem cell (CSC) plasticity. Despite the established role of EMT in therapeutic resistance and CSC maintenance, targeting EMT pathways remains challenging because of their complexity and dynamic interplay with CSCs. Khalighfard <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] analyzed plasma miRNA/mRNA profiles in CRC patients who received 30 sessions of RT and found that miR-101-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-34a-5p were upregulated and that miR-221-3p and miR-17-5p were downregulated; this indicate that these miRNAs are potential tumor suppressors with diagnostic and predictive value in CRC[<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that miRNAs such as miR-145 and miR-101-3p are critical regulators of EMT, CSCs, and the radiation response, representing actionable targets to overcome radioresistance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</title><p>In addition to miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs are key regulators of CRC radiosensitivity. SNORA28 promotes the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 at the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor promoter and activates the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor/Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling axis by recruiting bromodomain-containing protein 4, thereby reducing the radiosensitivity of CRC[<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Understanding these mechanisms may aid in the development of personalized RT strategies, maximizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity and resistance in CRC treatment.</p><p>Key challenges in targeting ncRNAs to increase CRC radiosensitivity include their complex mechanistic roles in DNA repair, apoptosis, and metabolic pathways, complicating the identification of dominant targets (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, signal transducer and activator or ribosomal RNA modification). Clinical translation of ncRNA biomarkers (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, small nucleolar RNA/LncRNA panels) is hindered by limited validation in liquid biopsies for distinguishing radiation-resistant subtypes. Functional redundancy among ncRNA classes (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, lncRNA-circRNA sponging) and delivery challenges (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, tumor-specific nanoparticle targeting) further impedes therapeutic precision.</p><p>In the near future, it will be important to emphasize the ability to integrative multiomics approaches, such as single-cell transcriptomics and spatial proteomics, to decipher dynamic ncRNA networks in radiation-induced immune evasion or ferroptosis. Precision therapies could involve the combination of ncRNA modulation and radiosensitizers to disrupt metabolic adaptations such as glutamine dependency or target ncRNA-immune checkpoint crosstalk, such as that involving lncRNA-programmed death ligand 1. Artificial intelligence-driven predictive frameworks trained on multi-RNA profiles may refine patient stratification for personalized RT. Cross-cancer insights, leveraging conserved ncRNA pathways, could accelerate CRC-specific discoveries. These efforts aim to bridge mechanistic complexity with clinical translation, advancing ncRNA-targeted therapies to increase radiosensitivity and overcome radioresistance.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the field of CRC research, ongoing investigations into ncRNAs are providing valuable insights for improving RT outcomes. To date, findings indicate that ncRNAs, such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, significantly influence CRC radiosensitivity through diverse mechanisms, including epigenetic reprogramming and posttranscriptional regulation. These molecules can either increase or reduce radiosensitivity, resulting in a complex regulatory landscape. Clinically, ncRNAs show promise as biomarkers for predicting radiosensitivity and prognosis and as potential therapeutic targets to overcome radioresistance. However, challenges persist in fully harnessing their potential. Future research should focus on multiomics integration to better understand ncRNA networks, develop precision combination therapies, utilize Artificial intelligence-driven models for patient stratification, and draw on cross-cancer insights to accelerate CRC-specific discoveries. Addressing these challenges and exploring innovative strategies will be crucial for translating ncRNA research into clinical applications, ultimately enhancing personalized RT approaches and improving the outcomes of advanced CRC patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
