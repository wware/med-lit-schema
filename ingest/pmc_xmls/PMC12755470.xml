INTRODUCTION</title><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer for incidence.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Even though lots of factors are being investigated to explain these trends and the different incidence rates of BC in various populations, there is yet no consensus. Among those factors, mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been investigated for a long time. Others factors which have been reported are alteration in menstruation (early menarche age and delayed menopause), alteration in reproduction (late age at first birth), hormone levels, intake of alcohol, as well as obesity.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that obesity and weight gain were risk factors and associated with poor prognosis of BC and the mechanisms for this connection may be related to resistance to insulin, chronic hyperinsulinemia, local inflammation, adipokine secretion, such as leptin (LEP), and more exposure of estrogen.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the exact pathogenesis is still unclear. Thus, the main focus for BC risk was gradually shifted to obesity-related genes.</p><p>LEP is a 16-kDa adipocyte-derived peptide hormone that plays a vital role in conrtolling food intake, energy expenditure and neuroendocrine function. In obese subjects, high levels of leptin have been frequently observed.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition to playing an important role in regulating energy expenditure and body weight, leptin is vital for tumor cell growth and exerts its biologic effects through selective binding to the leptin receptor (LEPR). LEPR, which is encoded by LEPR gene (located on chromosome 1p21) is a single membrane-spanning receptor of the class I cytokine receptor family and expressed in many tissues including the mammary gland.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, it was hypothesized that polymorphisms in the LEPR gene could modulate individual differences in levels of LEPR and thus may play a role in contributing to an alteration in the biologic effects of LEP, leading to an effect on the susceptibility to BC. Several polymorphisms in the LEPR gene including rs1137101, rs1137100, rs1137100, rs8179183, rs4655537, and rs3762274 have been identified. In addition, several common sequence variants have been described and their potential associations with obesity have been proposed.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Nevertheless, their potential associations with BC risk have not been fully investigated. Among them, Q223R (rs1137101)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and K109R (rs1137100)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> polymorphisms for BC have been most commonly studied. However, the results were inconsistent. Taking K109R, for example, several studies reported positive relationships,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> whereas others held different views.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The results of those published meta-analyses<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> were also inconclusive and contradictory because of limited sample sizes or diverse ethnicity. Thus, more comprehensive and well-designed meta-analyses with larger samples should be performed.</p><p>As some new studies published, a system review and meta-analysis of all relevant literatures for the association between Q223R and K109R polymorphisms and BC risk was conducted in order to raise more reliable evidence and insights.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2. METHODS</title><sec><title>2.1. Searching strategy</title><p>An electronic literature search which was restricted to humans was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases without language restrictions using the following searching strategy: (<italic toggle="yes">leptin receptor</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">LEPR</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Q223R</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">K109R</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">rs1137101</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">rs1137100</italic>) and (<italic toggle="yes">polymorphisms</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">SNP</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">variant</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">variants</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">variation</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">genotype</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">genetic</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">mutation</italic>) and (<italic toggle="yes">BC</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">mammary cancer</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">mammary adenocarcinoma</italic>). The last search was updated in February 21, 2023.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (a) studies had a case-control design to assess the association between LEPR Q223R (rs1137101) and/or K109R (rs1137100) polymorphisms and BC risk in humans; (b) genotype frequencies were provided. (c) the full text was available and it reported genotype frequencies in cases and controls, or sufficient data to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p><p>Studies were excluded if they: (a) were not a case-control study; (b) did not report precise genotypes; (c) were duplicate publications of data from the same study; (d) were meta-analyses, letters, reviews, or editorial articles; and (e) investigated other polymorphisms of LEPR.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3. Data extraction</title><p>Two authors (S.L.Z. and J.R.Y.) independently selected eligible studies and extracted the following data: the surname of first author, year of publication, ethnicity, country, sample size, type of controls, genotyping method, genotype distribution, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among controls, and matched parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4. Assessment of methodological quality</title><p>The quality of included studies was assessed independently by two investigators (S.L.Z. and J.R.Y.) using the Newcastle&#8211;Ottawa Scale.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Scores of 0 to 4 were considered to indicate poor methodological quality; scores of 5 to 9, high quality.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Any disagreements about scoring were resolved through comprehensive reassessment by the other authors. Only high-quality studies were included in the meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5. Statistical analysis</title><p>The strength of association of Q223R and K109R polymorphisms with BC risk was calculated in terms of unadjusted OR with 95% CIs based on genotype frequencies in cases and controls. The significance of pooled OR was determined using the Z test, with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 defined as significant. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effect model when <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; 0.10 for the Q test, indicating lack of heterogeneity among studies; otherwise, meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effect model. All statistical tests for meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration). Publication bias was assessed using Begg&#8217;s funnel plot and Egger&#8217;s weighted regression in Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA), with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>3.

DISCUSSION</title><p>Polymorphisms in LEPR gene and their potential associations with cancer risk have been explored.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In recent years, increasing evidence from meta-analyses have indicated a significant association between LEPR polymorphisms and BC risk. Meta-analysis by Wang et al<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> with nine case-control studies suggested that Q223R and K109R polymorphisms were significantly correlated with BC risk and the A allele of Q223R variant and the G allele of K109R variant were low-penetrant risk factors for developing BC. Meta-analysis by Wang et al<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> with 11 case-control studies also showed A allele of Q233R variant was low-penetrant risk factor for developing BC. Meta-analysis by Shi et al<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> with five case-control studies indicated that the K109R genetic polymorphism did not significantly affect the risk of cancer, but in the stratified analysis, A allele of K109R were found protective against under additive genetic model. Meta-analysis by Liu and Liu<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> with nine case-control studies showed that the association between Q223R and BC risk was only statistically significant in East Asians, but not in Caucasians or Africans. Similarly, meta-analysis by Luan et al<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> with 13 case-control studies showed that Q223R polymorphism could decrease BC risk in Asians but not in overall individuals and Caucasians. Different from their results,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> the data from the current meta-analysis with 20 case-control studies indicated that G-allele and GG genotype but not A allele of Q223R may protect against BC only in Africans. On the contrary, A-allele and AA genotype of Q223R may confer increasing BC risk in Africans. It is possible that larger sample size may lead to the identification of statistically significant correlation. The current study contains more case-control studies with larger sample, making our results should be more reliable. It is worth mentioning that the results of a meta-analysis by Sayad et al<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> with only 14 case-control studies for Q223R published in 2021 were similar to ours. Our data also suggested that GG genotype of K109R in Asian population may also protect against BC, while AG genotype of K109R in Asian population may confer elevated susceptibility of BC.</p><p>Significant results were obtained and we really hope they would provide a reference for future studies, nonetheless, several limitations that may affect interpretation of the results still existed in this work. First, the significant results on Q223R were only got from two case-control studies in African population. Given the limited sample size, more multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to clarify the relationships. Indeed, neither in total nor in Asian and Caucasian population significant association between Q223R polymorphism and BC risk was observed. Second, the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value for HWE was less than 0.05 in five studies of Q223R polymorphism<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and one study of K109R polymorphism,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> suggesting that these populations may not be representative of the broader target population. Nevertheless, we decided to retain these studies in the meta-analysis because the corresponding pooled ORs were not substantially altered in any of the five models after excluding one at a time. Third, confounding factors, such as menopausal, menstruation status, tumor status, BMI, or age may affect the results. However, not all studies reported these baseline data or aggregated them in different ways, resulting in a failure to include them in the meta-analysis. Last, methods which were used to test polymorphisms were not uniform and they varied in sensitivity and specificity, leading to a reduction of the robustness in this meta-analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, this study performed an extensive assessment based on a larger sample size than the previous pooled analysis and suggested that LEPR Q223R polymorphism may be significantly associated with BC risk in African population. And LEPR K109R polymorphism may be significantly associated with BC risk in Asian population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflicts of interest: The authors declare
