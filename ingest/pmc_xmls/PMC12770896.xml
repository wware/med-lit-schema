While it initially focused on diagnosing rare monogenic conditions, it has expanded to include risk prediction for more prevalent, complex diseases from primarily focusing on rare monogenic conditions to the prediction of risk for prevalent complex conditions
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup>. This evolution has also contributed to a wider interest in the use of genetic testing across a variety of contexts, including both clinical and consumer-driven settings. Providing information on predispositions for specific diseases or conditions is seen as a way forward to empower citizens and patients, enabling them to proactively manage their health and potentially prevent the (early) onset of certain conditions
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>. This growing interest in personal genetic risk information has also been capitalized on by private companies, resulting in the rise of direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT). The utilization of genetic information to inform lifestyle changes aimed at improving health outcomes, has also captured the attention of private companies. Over the past two decades we have witnessed the emergence of several models to provide genetic testing information directly to the public. Commercial laboratories have been increasingly marketing and selling a wide range of genetic tests online, allowing consumers to purchase them directly without requiring a healthcare professional&#8217;s involvement or prescription
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup>. The online format of DTC-GT quickly gained popularity due to its accessibility and affordability
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>The model of direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) deviates from the traditional provision of genetic testing information, in which a healthcare professional is responsible for ordering, testing, interpreting, and communicating genetic testing results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup>. In the DTC-GT model, consumers usually order a test kit online after approving terms of services. Upon receiving a test kit at home, consumers are instructed to produce a saliva sample and to send it to the DTC-GT company for genetic analysis. Once the analysis is complete, test results are directly delivered to the consumer through a personalized online platform or mobile application
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>DTC-GT offerings cover a broad spectrum of services and are generally divided into health-related and non-health-related categories. Non-health-related DTC-GT tests include services such as ancestry testing, paternity testing, and assessments of specific traits (e.g. earwax type). Health-related DTC-GT, on the other hand, encompass various types of testing, including susceptibility testing for polygenic and multifactorial conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes), carrier screening for autosomal recessive conditions (e.g. cystic fibrosis) and/or X-linked conditions (e.g. Fragile X syndrome) to inform reproductive decision making, and pharmacogenomic tests to provide insights into personal drug responses
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup>. Differentiating between health and non-health-related DTC-GT offers can however be complex, particularly with the availability of third-party interpretation services. These services allow consumers to analyze their uninterpreted raw genetic data. As a result, they may also report certain variants and risk scores that fall outside the scope of the DTC-GT test that was originally purchased
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, these services blur the line between genetic health risk information and non-health-related DTC-GT products, which adds complexity to regulatory efforts
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>DTC-GT offers that provide health information are currently widely available in many countries at a moderate cost
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup>. As of 2023, 23andMe &#8211; a prominent player in the field &#8211; has a customer base exceeding 14 million genotyped customers
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup>. Surveys in the USA and Australia found that the majority (77% and 65% respectively) of those with experience with genetic testing were consumers of DTC-GT
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup>. While the exact number of consumers in Europe remains unknown to date, the uptake of DTC-GT is also believed to be substantial
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup>. The global DTC-GT market is expected to further grow and to be worth over $4 billion by 2025 because of advances in technology, increased consumer demand and the desire for personalized health management
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup>. The rapid growth of the DTC-GT market has however raised several concerns with regard to the privacy and security of genetic data, as well as the accuracy/validity of the test results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup>. The reliability of a positive test or increased risk result after DTC-GT remains limited, as the development of many genetic conditions is also influenced by other factors such as the environment and lifestyle choices. The majority of DTC-GT also do not sequence the entire genome. Instead, they often use SNP-chip genotyping, a method examining the presence or absence of specific variants in the genetic code, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions or deletions. While SNP-chip genotyping is effective in detecting common genetic variants, it tends to have a higher error rate when analyzing very rare variants, which can lead to an increased likelihood of false positives
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>More recently, some commercial companies have also started to offer whole genome or exome sequencing and the return of raw genomic data without interpretation
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>. These tests sequence nearly the entire genetic code and identify the genetic variants within it. The capability to predict disease risk through whole genome or exome sequencing data might motivate an increasing number of individuals to explore genomic technologies for personal health risk prediction
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup>. Yet even though data obtained from whole genome or exome sequencing can be valuable for understanding rare conditions in specific individuals, there is currently inadequate evidence to prove that expanding this technology to the general population would result in considerable benefits
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup>. Interpretation of genetic variants is still challenging and largely depends on context
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>. The predictive significance of a "disease-causing variant" is often substantially diminished when identified without the presence of a family history linked to the relevant condition
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup>. To date, the scientific understanding of genomic sequencing data remains incomplete, creating uncertainties about the real added value of this extensive information.</p><p>Since the emergence of DTC-GT, stakeholders have voiced and debated several potential risks and benefits
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup>. A particular concern has been the potential impact of DTC-GT on healthcare systems, particularly in terms of downstream effects, such as an increased demand for specialist consultations and follow-up testing. Since DTC-GT companies frequently recommend that consumers consult healthcare professionals for assistance in interpreting and using genetic health risk information, this could potentially have an impact on healthcare systems. Healthcare professionals have also voiced that they feel obligated to refer patients to specialists or suggest additional screening procedures based on DTC-GT results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup>. A previous systematic literature review by Stewart
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2018), which covered studies up to January 2017, found that one-third of participants shared their results with at least one healthcare professional, often leading to additional follow-up tests
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup>. This review, however, specifically focused on sharing behavior and health care utilization following multiplex genetic testing, excluding tests related to nutrigenetics, pharmacogenetics, sports genetics, as well as those for highly penetrant genes and prenatal or neonatal testing
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, Stewart
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2018) focused solely on the sharing behavior of DTC-GT consumers and did not include any findings on the experiences of healthcare professionals regarding DTC-GT consumers sharing their test results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Given the rapid expansion of the DTC-GT market and the increasing diversity of test offers and DTC-GT users, we aim to provide an updated overview based on the current available evidence. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review was to assess: (1) the sharing behavior of actual DTC-GT consumers, (2) experiences of healthcare professionals regarding DTC-GT consumers sharing their test results and (3) healthcare utilization following DTC-GT, with a particular focus on validation of DTC-GT results and subsequent clinical actions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42024517079.</p><sec><title>Design and search strategy</title><p>Our review process consisted of three steps. First, we performed a systematic literature search to identify relevant publications in three different databases: Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE. No restrictions on the publication date were applied during the initial search. On January 2

In a second phase, we consulted references from relevant papers to find any additional publications warranting inclusion (i.e. snowball method). Our review followed PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews

</sup>. (see
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) Initially, all records identified were screened based on their title and abstract by two individual researchers (EVS and KD). After the exclusion of non-relevant records, the same two researchers (EVS and KD) independently assessed the full texts of the remaining records.

Studies reporting on non-empirical work (e.g. case studies, commentaries, review, books, guidelines, etc.) were excluded. Only studies that evaluated the sharing behavior of DTC-GT consumers after they had received their test results were eligible for inclusion. Actual DTC-GT consumers were defined as individuals who either paid for DTC-GT out of pocket or were offered DTC-GT at a subsidized rate or for free in a research context. Studies that assessed the willingness to share DTC-GT results prior to obtaining the test results or in a hypothetical context (non-actual DTC-GT consumers) were excluded from this review. Likewise, we also excluded studies that reported on health care professionals being asked questions by patients about DTC-GT before undergoing the test. When a single research project was reported in multiple publications (evaluation of sharing behavior at multiple time points), we included the publication that evaluated sharing behavior at the most recent time point.

In the first round of data extraction, we assessed study characteristics by focusing on the following variables for studies examining the sharing behavior of DTC-GT consumers: first author, year of publication, country of the research team, study name (if applicable), research methods, key demographic characteristics of study participants, information on which DTC-GT product/service participants had used, actual or hypothetical DTC-GT consumers, whether sharing behavior of DTC-GT consumers was assessed before or after receiving test results and whether DTC-GT consumers paid out-of-pocket or were offered DTC-GT at a subsidized rate or for free in a research context. In addition, the following information was sought for those studies that explored the experiences of different health care professionals with DTC-GT consumers sharing their test results: first author, year of publication, country of the research team, research methods, type of health care professionals. In the second phase, we extracted data about the sharing behavior of DTC-GT consumers. For this, we focused on whether DTC-GT consumers shared their test results with health care professionals (including primary care professional; genetic counselor; clinical geneticist, and other healthcare professionals) or family members (such as spouse, parents, siblings, children, and other extended family members). Other healthcare professionals (e.g. oncologist, clinical nurse) were grouped into a single overarching category. Extended family members were defined to include aunts, uncles, cousins or grandparents. Within the studies that explored the experiences of health care professionals with DTC-GT consumers sharing their test results we focused on whether participants had patients sharing DTC-GT with them and the number of patients who brought in results from DTC-GT. In a final stage, we examined healthcare utilization following DTC-GT. We specifically investigated whether results from DTC-GT were validated through further testing and whether any subsequent clinical actions were performed based on the DTC-GT findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality appraisal</title><p>We performed an indicative quality appraisal of the included primary studies using the tool developed by Hawker

</p><p>Overall, we identified 13 studies assessing healthcare utilization following DTC-GT, with a particular focus on the validation of DTC-GT results and subsequent clinical actions. An early study by Powel
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2012) found that four out of five primary care physicians who encountered patients bringing in DTC-GT results did not alter their patient&#8217;s medical management
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>
</sup>. However, other studies did report on several instances of DTC-GT result validation and clinical actions performed based on the DTC-GT findings. Krieger
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2016) reported that 9% (n=55/617) of participants stated to have received additional genetic tests, medical exams, screenings, procedures, and/or scans as a result of the genetic information they had received through DTC-GT
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
</sup>. A similar result was reported by Lee
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2020) in a web-based survey among adult adoptees following DTC-GT. In this study 18% (n=5) of respondents received additional testing or procedures based on DTC-GT results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
</sup>. A qualitative interview study by Francke
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2013) examined the experiences of 11 women who tested positive for BRCA through DTC-GT. Among them, one had undergone a prophylactic mastectomy, while three others had planned the procedure. Additionally, three had undergone oophorectomies, and four had planned to do so after completing childbearing. Five participants sought breast exams and imaging following their results, while seven participants who neither had nor planned to undergo mastectomies reported continuing regular breast cancer monitoring. Furthermore, 30 secondary BRCA tests were conducted on family members as a result of the initial DTC-GT result, either through a health care professional or 23andMe, yielding 13 positive and 17 negative results. In one mutation-positive secondary case, early-stage breast cancer was detected. Several family members with BRCA-positive results had already undergone prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy, while others indicated plans to pursue these risk-reducing procedures in the future
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Jonas
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2019) reported that 40% of healthcare professionals (primary and specialty care physicians) who received DTC-GT results from patients made referrals to other healthcare professionals in the preceding year. Among these referrals, 78% were made to clinical geneticists and genetic counselors, while 22% were made to other health care professionals (e.g. clinical pharmacists)
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
</sup>. Trained genetic professionals also reported to have referred patients to other health care professionals in the study by Giovanni
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2010). In this study, 15 specialists in clinical genetics (n=15/22, 68%) had referred patients to at least one other health care professional
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>
</sup>. In the Australian study conducted by Millward
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2020), which examined clinical genetics service referrals related to DTC-GT over ten years (2010&#8211;2019), there was considerable variation in the number of DTC-GT related referrals across the different publicly funded services surveyed
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. While most services lacked specific procedures/guidelines for managing DTC-GT related referrals, six services reported that validating DTC-GT results was the most frequently performed clinical action following an appointment
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. Overall, these services estimated that they had attempted to validate DTC-GT results for 34 patients, of which only 3 (9%) were confirmed as correct
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. In the PGen study, 11% (n=105/961) of DTC-GT consumers stated to have undergone follow-up tests, examinations, and procedures based on their DTC-GT results six months after obtaining their test results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
</sup>. A similar finding was also reported by Kaufman
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2012) where on average 10% of DTC-GT consumers reported following up their results with additional laboratory tests. This percentage was higher among those participants who had shared their DTC-GT test results with a health care professional (26%) compared to those who did not (2%)
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, 27% of participants in the SGHI research study reported that their physicians had ordered additional tests based on the DTC-GT results they received
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</sup>. Another American study by Elson
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2020) explored the outcomes of receiving DTC-GT results for the two most common genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism (Factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210G&gt;A). In this study, 21% of variant-positive individuals were advised by health care professionals to undergo repeat genetic testing in a clinical lab, 13% were advised to have additional testing for other clotting disorders, and 15% were recommended to have relatives tested. About 28% (n=82/294) of cases reported that their relatives also underwent genetic testing based on their DTC-GT results. Within this group, 34% (n=28/82) reported that their family members received genetic testing through a healthcare professional and 17% (n=14/82) through a combination of DTC-GT and a health care professional
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
</sup>. In another study by Koop
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2021), six participants indicated to have pursued evaluation with a specialist in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) due to their positive DTC-GT result. Additionally, three participants saw a HH specialist because a family member tested positive on commercial DNA testing for HH. Three participants also stated that a primary care physician ordered additional genetic testing due to a positive DTC-GT result, with one participant receiving conflicting results from formal gene testing
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
</sup>. Finally, in the study by Ashenhurst
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2022), 26.4% of participants with a physician-diagnosed Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) received their diagnosis only after receiving their 23andMe test results and 50% of individuals with a PI*ZZ genotype (identified through DTC-GT) had received a diagnosis of AATD by a physician

</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of this systematic review offer a detailed synthesis of the sharing behavior and healthcare utilization following DTC-GT, based on the most current available scientific evidence. Compared to the previous review by Stewart
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2018), which identified 14 articles on the sharing behavior of DTC-GT consumers, our review identified 40 articles which specifically examined the sharing behavior of actual DTC-GT consumers, experiences of health care professionals with DTC-GT consumers sharing their test results and/or healthcare utilization following DTC-GT
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup>. Our analysis indicates that a considerable number of individuals who underwent DTC-GT have disclosed their test results to both healthcare professionals and family members. The proportion of DTC-GT consumers who report to have shared their DTC-GT results with healthcare professionals has remained relatively stable in recent years. However, the likelihood of sharing these results seems to be influenced, to some extent, by the cost of the test. Specifically, those who received subsidized or free tests were more likely to share their results, particularly to primary healthcare professionals, compared to those who paid out-of-pocket. This suggests that individuals who pay out-of-pocket for DTC-GT tests may be less motivated to engage with healthcare professionals. Surprisingly, only four of the primary studies we identified assessed the motivations behind consumers&#8217; decisions to share their DTC-GT results
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
</sup>. The choice to either share or withhold DTC-GT results from healthcare professionals appears to be driven by a variety of motivational factors. Given that not all instances of sharing DTC-GT results will automatically lead to increased medical utilization, as was also demonstrated by the included studies, it is important to gain a better understanding of the underlying motivations of DTC-GT consumers for sharing their test results.</p><p>While not all DTC-GT consumers shared their test results with healthcare professionals, there is a notable trend of increasing interactions between DTC-GT consumers and health care professionals. This is particularly visible in studies assessing the experiences of genetic health professionals. For example, data from a 2017 survey of genetic counselors active in the US reveal that 40% had seen at least one consumer in the clinic solely for the purpose of reviewing DTC-GT test results, and 76% had been queried about DTC-GT by at least one patient
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>
</sup>. This represents a significant rise from an earlier survey performed in 2008, where only 14% of genetic counselors reported receiving such requests
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>
</sup>. This increase could be explained by the growing number of actual DTC-GT consumers. Considering the ongoing growth in the DTC-GT industry, it is likely that the impact of DTC-GT on healthcare systems will continue to increase in the future
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>
</sup>. As more DTC-GT companies continue to develop partnerships with physician intermediaries in the ordering and test reporting process, patients may also potentially turn to these professionals for additional health information and advice
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
</sup>. Findings from the Scripps Genomic Health Initiative indicate that offering free genetic counseling and proactive outreach organized by DTC-GT companies could increase the likelihood of DTC-GT consumers discussing their DTC-GT results with a trained genetic professional
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</sup>. This highlights the importance of facilitating proactive post-test communication through trained healthcare professionals employed by DTC-GT companies, which could help consumers better understand their results and potentially reduce the need for (unnecessary) follow-up consultations within the healthcare system
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>
</sup>. By prioritizing ethical and consumer-focused practices, DTC-GT companies could enhance transparency, improve accessibility, and build trust in their services.</p><p>The impact of DTC-GT on healthcare systems has been a subject of considerable debate
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>
</sup>. Initial concerns about DTC-GT suggested that it could lead to a significant burden on healthcare systems, including increased downstream tests, procedures, and referrals to specialists. Many of the anticipated issues have not manifested as expected based on current findings. It seems that previous studies that assessed sharing behavior more hypothetically have overestimated the proportion of consumers that would share DTC-GT results with a health care professional
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup>. Most recent study findings indicate that patients sharing results from DTC-GT only constitute a small proportion of the total amount of patient visits in clinical (genetics) services
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. Nevertheless, clinical actions (e.g. testing of family members) were taken for some DTC-GT related referrals clinical actions, which also demonstrates the impact that DTC-GT could have on the health care system
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. The ongoing shift from testing for monogenic disorders to screening for polygenic conditions could also further impact the healthcare system, as polygenic risk scores add complexity, making interpretation more challenging for both consumers and healthcare professionals
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>
</sup>. As genetic information becomes more complex, more individuals may seek professional guidance, potentially increasing demand for healthcare services and straining healthcare resources. Unlike monogenic conditions, where genetic variants typically have well-established clinical significance, polygenic risk scores remain less straightforward to interpret and validate. Without standardized guidelines and sufficient resources, inconsistent interpretation could again lead to unnecessary consultations and inefficient use of healthcare services.</p><p>A recent Australian study investigating the impact of DTC-GT on clinical genetics services revealed that while most referrals resulted in patient appointments, the willingness of services to offer appointments varied
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. Healthcare professionals have also voiced to feel pressured to refer patients for clinical confirmatory testing of DTC-GT results and/or additional screening/testing, especially considering the evidence of the high error rate of DTC-GT. A recent American study by Tandy-Connor
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2018) found that 63% (31/49) of patients that were seeking confirmatory testing of their obtained raw data through third-party interpretation services did not receive important genetic health risk information within their original DTC-GT report
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>
</sup>. In the same study, it was also discovered that 40% of the reported variants across a range of patient samples turned out to be false positives
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>
</sup>. Results were even more concerning in the survey study among Australian clinical genetics services, where fewer than 10% of variants were confirmed among referrals of DTC-GT consumers who had used third-party interpretation services
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. The need for confirmatory testing to prevent inappropriate patient care and medical management could present significant challenges in healthcare systems facing financial constraints and systemic barriers, such as limited access to specialized care or testing services. Furthermore, appointments involving DTC-GT consumers may also redirect healthcare resources away from patients with a clear clinical indication which might present challenges to ensure equitable healthcare delivery
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup>. In response to these issues, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the British Society for Genetic Medicine issued a position statement in 2019 advising against referrals to clinical genetics services solely based on DTC-GT results. Instead, they recommend conducting a thorough risk assessment and evaluating family medical history prior to considering referrals in accordance with standard clinical pathways and protocols
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>
</sup>. This differs from the position statement issued by the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) which recommend that &#8220;Results obtained through at-home genetic tests should be reviewed with a genetics specialist, as some findings may need to be confirmed in a clinical laboratory before being used in healthcare decision-making&#8221;
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Interestingly, our findings indicate that DTC-GT consumers more often shared their results with primary health care professionals (e.g. GP) rather than with trained genetic professionals
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
</sup>. Prior research has demonstrated that primary healthcare professionals lack time and feel unprepared or unqualified to take on the gatekeeping role expected of them when helping their patients navigating DTC-GT results

<xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>
</sup>. A particular proportion of referrals to the Australian clinical genetics services that were surveyed in the study of Millward
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2020) were made by GPs who were unsure about the significance of the results that their patients had received
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup>. These findings underscore the urgent need for better education and training for GPs and primary care health care professionals in handling genetic information. As primary points of contact in the healthcare system, these health care professionals must be equipped with concrete practice guidelines to guide decisions about referral and follow-up care for those results requiring specialist attention
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
</sup>. In a study by McGrath
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2019), medical providers without specific training in genetics but with prior experience consulting DTC-GT consumers were more likely to accurately interpret genetic test results compared to those without any prior experience with genetic test consultations
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>
</sup>. This improved ability may stem from these providers actively seeking additional information to assist with interpretation and counseling, which ultimately helps them develop and enhance their skills in this area
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>
</sup>. This finding suggests that integrating genetics education into the curricula of various (primary) healthcare professionals could be highly beneficial

Future updates of this review might incorporate these MeSH terms to enhance the precision and comprehensiveness of the search strategy. Variability in follow-up duration across studies may have influenced the observed rates of information sharing and medical follow-up, as participants with longer follow-up periods may have had more opportunities to act upon the information received. However, detailed information on the exact timing of follow-up was not consistently available across all studies, limiting our ability to adjust for this factor. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting cross-study comparisons. Additionally, some included articles originated from the same research projects (e.g., PGen Study, Scripps Genomic Health Initiative), raising the possibility of overlapping participant data. While each publication addressed distinct research questions or subgroups, some duplication of outcomes&#8212;particularly related to data sharing and health care utilization&#8212;may have occurred. We mitigated this by analyzing each article independently and clearly reporting the origin of each study to support transparency and allow readers to interpret the findings in context.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research</title><p>Variations in research designs, outcome measures, and participant characteristics across the identified studies complicate direct comparisons and hinder the ability to draw definitive conclusions. This observed heterogeneity underscores the need for more standardized approaches. Conducting further international studies with consistent outcome measures would be highly beneficial in gaining deeper insights into the broader impact of DTC-GT on healthcare systems. Such research would not only enable more meaningful comparisons but also contribute to a clearer understanding of DTC-GT's implications across diverse healthcare contexts. The current body of literature remains heavily focused on the U.S. context, with limited exploration of sharing behavior and health care utilization following DTC-GT in other regions of the world. As healthcare systems, cultural norms, and healthcare access vary greatly across regions, conducting studies in diverse international contexts would provide a more comprehensive view of the global implications of DTC-GT.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of this systematic review provide a comprehensive overview of the current scientific evidence on the sharing behaviors and healthcare utilization patterns following DTC-GT. While initial concerns about DTC-GT's impact on the health care system have not fully materialized, the increasing number of consumers engaging with healthcare professionals underscores the need for preparedness and appropriate policy responses. Policymakers and healthcare institutions must also take proactive measures to equip health care professionals&#8212;particularly those in primary care&#8212;with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the evolving challenges associated with DTC-GT. Given that general practitioners are often the first point of contact for DTC-GT consumers, enhancing their genetic literacy through targeted training programs and decision-support tools could help mitigate the risk of unnecessary referrals, misinterpretation of results, and inefficient healthcare utilization. As the majority of existing literature focuses on high-income countries, significant gaps remain in understanding how DTC-GT is utilized in regions with differing healthcare infrastructures, regulatory frameworks, and access to genetic services. Future research should therefore prioritize standardizing study methodologies and expanding investigations beyond the U.S. context to better capture the global impact of DTC-GT.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>No ethics and consent were required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Sylvia Metcalfe for generously dedicating her time and expertise to conducting additional analysis on the Genioz study dataset.

<bold>Review of Revision to &#8220;Sharing Behavior and Health Care Utilization Following Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing: A Systematic Review&#8221;</bold>
</p><p> The authors have done a commendable job addressing concerns raised during the initial review. I have only a few remaining issues:</p><p>
<bold>Treatment of Duplicate Data Reporting:</bold>
</p><p> The handling of repeated reporting of the same results remains problematic. While the authors have been transparent in their analytic approach, it is clear that citations 40, 41, and 44 from the PGen Study report data from the same participant cohort, not distinct subgroups. Variations in sharing percentages stem from differing analytic strategies (e.g., handling of missing data), not from subgroup differences. Treating these findings as independent data points artificially triples the weight of a single study in the boxplots. I recommend omitting data from citations 40 and 41 when constructing the boxplots. Additionally, using boxplots that assign equal weight to studies with 20 participants and those with over 30,000 is methodologically questionable.</p><p>
<bold>Discussion of Study Design Differences:</bold>
</p><p> The Discussion section should address differences in DTC recipients and study designs as potential sources of data discrepancies. For example, the study reporting only 1% of participants sharing results with clinicians was the Multiplex Initiative, which (a) excluded patients with any of the eight common conditions examined by the genetic test, and (b) conducted follow-up only three months post-disclosure. The combination of a very healthy cohort and short follow-up likely explains the low clinician-sharing rate.</p><p>
<bold>Clarification of the Multiplex Initiative&#8217;s Nature:</bold>

To ensure transparency, we have integrated the following paragraph into the body of the text.
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;The quality appraisal of the included studies, conducted using Hawker et al.&#8217;s (2002) framework, revealed that most articles were generally of good quality across key domains such as titles and abstracts, introductions, methodology, data analysis, results, and implications. However, recurring limitations emerged in areas related to sampling, ethics, and bias, as well as transferability or generalizability, where many studies were rated only &#8220;fair&#8221; or occasionally &#8220;poor.&#8221; Despite these weaknesses, nearly all studies were judged to present findings that were useful and relevant to the research questions.&#8221;</italic>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Most of the numerical analysis in the text involves ranges across studies that are often large and thus, somewhat meaningless, (i.e.1% to 57% is given as the proportion who share their test results with a HCP) and do not necessarily support their conclusions in the Discussion such as "Our analysis indicates that a considerable number of individuals who underwent DTC-GT have disclosed their test results to both healthcare professionals and family members".

More details regarding how the data are distributed would be helpful and perhaps support some of the conclusions. They correctly compare ranges across categories.</p></list-item></list> We recognize that the reported ranges across studies are wide, reflecting considerable variability in the primary data. To ensure comprehensive transparency, all underlying data and study-specific results, including sample sizes and contextual details, are provided in the accompanying tables. In response to this concern, we have enhanced the boxplot figures by including more detailed information to better depict the data distribution. Furthermore, the manuscript text has been expanded to describe these features more thoroughly and offer clearer context for interpreting the figures. We believe these improvements increase clarity about the distribution of the data and strengthen the support for our conclusions.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Also lacking are summarizing key demographic features of respondents such as level of education which could impact results and conclusions.</p></list-item></list> We would like to underline that this information is available to the reader in Table 1.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>An overview of the types of results reported would also be informative.</p></list-item></list> We would like to emphasize that the data provided in the primary studies do not permit such detailed analysis and reporting. In many cases, it is unclear which specific types of results participants received. When available, we have included details of the company and test used in Table 1; however, we acknowledge that this information remains limited.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There are additional limitations of the data not reported such as few articles about family sharing broke down categories of family members, for example, so please note any gaps or deficiencies in the literature your reviewed. For example, it is noted that the data tend to be US-centric.</p></list-item></list> We would like to direct your attention to the final paragraph of our discussion section, where we address these concerns. We highlight the considerable variation and heterogeneity in study designs and measures that complicate direct comparisons, emphasizing the need for more standardized approaches in future research. Additionally, we discuss the current U.S.-centric focus of the literature and underscore the importance of conducting more international studies to better capture diverse healthcare systems and cultural contexts.
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Variations in research designs, outcome measures, and participant characteristics across the identified studies complicate direct comparisons and hinder the ability to draw definitive conclusions. This observed heterogeneity underscores the need for more standardized approaches. Conducting further international studies with consistent outcome measures would be highly beneficial in gaining deeper insights into the broader impact of DTC-GT on healthcare systems. Such research would not only enable more meaningful comparisons but also contribute to a clearer understanding of DTC-GT's implications across diverse healthcare contexts. The current body of literature remains heavily focused on the U.S. context, with limited exploration of sharing behavior and health care utilization following DTC-GT in other regions of the world. As healthcare systems, cultural norms, and healthcare access vary greatly across regions, conducting studies in diverse international contexts would provide a more comprehensive view of the global implications of DTC-GT.&#8221;</italic> Minor comments:

The article is generally well-written, particularly in the Discussion section which presents thoughtful recommendations to address data gaps and methodological inconsistencies, as well as challenges for primary care professionals and other clinicians. I&#8217;m uncertain about how well some arguments are supported, however, due to uncertainties about how data in the examined studies were analyzed and due to instances where the authors did not note important differences testing approaches or study populations. The manuscript would benefit from addressing these following concerns:</p><p> &#160;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors note that six articles they analyzed were products of the PGen study and three articles were products of the Scripps Genomic Health Initiative. How did the authors address the potential for double-counting sharing data and health care utilization data?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adoptees are a focus of a few articles, including the one where 98% of study participants reported sharing results with family members. The manuscript would benefit from greater sensitivity to studies that focused on particular populations and study designs that deliberately tried to offer to DTC-GT to populations who may not have been motivated to pursue testing (e.g., the Multiplex Initiative).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The introduction is appropriately sensitive to differences between health-related and non-health-related DTC-GTs, as well as the differences in the types of health information provided by health-related DTC-GTs. Yet, the review&#8217;s analyses don&#8217;t seem sensitive to these important differences. Analyses of sharing with health care providers and health care utilization greater sensitivity to studies where health-relevant information was unlikely to be generated (e.g. ancestry-focused testing) and, conversely, studies where information sharing may be more likely (e.g., studies where testing provided carrier status).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p> Other Important Concerns</p><p> I did not see any key articles missing, but I encourage the authors to include &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening and Testing,&#8221; &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening&#8221; and &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Testing&#8221; in their search strings given that these are the preferred MeSH entries (perhaps intersecting with the MeSH term, &#8220;genetic testing&#8221;).</p><p> The time frame of the analyses is a little hard to identify for each study and may have a strong association with the likelihood of information sharing and medical follow-up.</p><p> In analyses of data from the Scripps Genomic Health Initiative, health care utilization was assessed as follows: &#8220;13 health screening behaviours were assessed by asking</p><p> about actual completion of a given screening test&#8230;&#8221; Are the authors sure that they&#8217;re summarizing data about health care utilization motivated by DTC-GT findings? Some of those services (e.g., glucose exam, blood test, mammogram) are common for patients as part of overall preventive care.</p><p> Minor Issues</p><p> The manuscript starts with a focus on monogenic disease risks and risk predictions and feels out-of-focus with the majority of their analyses which address broader range of DTC-GTs.</p><p> In the Introduction, the authors write, &#8220;The reliability of a positive test or increased risk result after DTC-GT remains limited, as the development of many genetic conditions is also influenced by other factors such as the environment and lifestyle choices.&#8221; I encourage the authors to address some of the challenges they address later in the manuscript related to high rates of analytic false positives, as well as concerns about potential misinterpretations of uninformative findings as negatives for genetic risk factors.</p><p> In Table 3A, the cell &#8220;Shared with HCP (=yes)&#8221; looks like it should have slightly different content and formatting.</p><p> Figures 2 and 3 would benefit from captions. I was unsure if lines represented medians across studies and x&#8217;s represent means. Also, some categories (genetic specialist, genetic counselor, medical geneticist) are not mutually exclusive.</p><p> In one place, those authors write that the Stewart paper was published in 2017.</p><p> The authors write, &#8220;Specifically, those who received subsidized or free tests were more likely to share their results, particularly to primary healthcare professionals, compared to those who paid out-of-pocket.&#8221; It may be helpful to understand whether those receiving subsidized or free tests were studies where testing was encouraged by researchers, and to note that individuals often pursue DTC-GT to avoid having results put in their medical records, as noted by the authors.</p><p> I don&#8217;t think the literature about the use of 3
<sup>rd</sup> party interpretation services is very relevant in the Introduction or Discussion, although I agree that the use of these services following DTC-GT is of great concern.</p><p>Are the rationale for, and objectives of, the Systematic Review clearly stated?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results presented in the review?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Medical, behavioral, and economic impact of genomic testing of healthy individuals</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body><sub-article article-type="response" id="comment4733-53178"><front-stub><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Van Steijvoort</surname><given-names initials="E">eva</given-names></name><aff>Public Health and Primary Care, KU Leuven, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium</aff></contrib></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>

How did the authors address the potential for double-counting sharing data and health care utilization data?</p></list-item></list> We appreciate the question regarding the potential for double-counting data in our analysis, particularly given that six of the included articles originated from the PGen Study and three from the Scripps Genomic Health Initiative. We have been transparent about the inclusion of multiple publications stemming from these two projects. This was clearly disclosed in our results sections. While the studies may share an overarching participant base, the individual publications addressed distinct research questions and often reported on participant subgroups. We recognize that there may be some overlap in study populations, which could pose limitations. By being transparent about the origins of the studies included, we enable readers to interpret the findings with appropriate context. We believe this transparency, combined with our careful analysis of each article, supports a methodologically sound and comprehensive synthesis. We have included the following paragraph in the Limitations section of the Discussion to fully and transparently address this issue. &#8220;Additionally, some included articles originated from the same research projects (e.g., PGen Study, Scripps Genomic Health Initiative), raising the possibility of overlapping participant data. While each publication addressed distinct research questions or subgroups, some duplication of outcomes&#8212;particularly related to data sharing and health care utilization&#8212;may have occurred. We mitigated this by analyzing each article independently and clearly reporting the origin of each study to support transparency and allow readers to interpret the findings in context.&#8221;

Throughout the manuscript, we have been attentive to the focus and context of each included study. We describe the study populations, recruitment strategies, and design features to ensure that readers understand the diversity of approaches and participant experiences represented in the literature. These details are integrated into our results and discussion sections, where we consider how differences in study design and target populations may influence outcomes such as result-sharing behavior or health care utilization.

<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;&#8230; However, the likelihood of sharing these results seems to be influenced, to some extent, by the cost of the test. Specifically, those who received subsidized or free tests were more likely to share their results, particularly to primary healthcare professionals, compared to those who paid out-of-pocket. This suggests that individuals who pay out-of-pocket for DTC-GT tests may be less motivated to engage with healthcare professionals.&#8221;</italic>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The introduction is appropriately sensitive to differences between health-related and non-health-related DTC-GTs, as well as the differences in the types of health information provided by health-related DTC-GTs. Yet, the review&#8217;s analyses don&#8217;t seem sensitive to these important differences. Analyses of sharing with health care providers and health care utilization greater sensitivity to studies where health-relevant information was unlikely to be generated (e.g. ancestry-focused testing) and, conversely, studies where information sharing may be more likely (e.g., studies where testing provided carrier status).</p></list-item></list> We agree with the reviewer that such a stratified analysis would be informative and insightful and would add valuable nuance to analyses of information sharing with healthcare providers and subsequent healthcare utilization. However, we would like to emphasize that the data reported in the primary studies do not support such a detailed analysis. In many instances, it is not clear what specific types of results participants received, and few studies distinguish between those who received health-related findings (e.g., carrier status) and those whose results were limited to non-health-related information (e.g., ancestry). Moreover, as discussed in our manuscript, the distinction between health-related and non-health-related DTC-GT results has become increasingly difficult to draw. The widespread availability of third-party interpretation services enables consumers to upload their raw genetic data and receive additional analyses. These services often provide information on genetic variants or risk scores that were not part of the original DTC-GT offering, thereby extending the scope of interpretation beyond what was initially intended. As a result, the line between health-related and non-health-related genetic information is increasingly blurred, complicating research efforts. This complexity limits our ability to meaningfully categorize participants&#8217; experiences based on the original test type and highlights the need for more detailed reporting in future studies to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions. Other Important Concerns I did not see any key articles missing, but I encourage the authors to include &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening and Testing,&#8221; &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening&#8221; and &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Testing&#8221; in their search strings given that these are the preferred MeSH entries (perhaps intersecting with the MeSH term, &#8220;genetic testing&#8221;). We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion regarding the inclusion of additional MeSH terms such as &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening and Testing,&#8221; &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening,&#8221; and &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Testing.&#8221; We agree that these are relevant terms and acknowledge their potential value for enhancing comprehensiveness. Our original search strategy, however, employed a broad range of commonly used text-based terms and phrases that align closely with MeSH indexing. As was noted by the reviewer, our current search did not appear to miss any key studies. Given this, and in the interest of maintaining consistency and transparency in our review process, we have elected not to re-run the search at this stage. However, we will make note of this in the limitations and would recommend incorporating these MeSH terms in future replications or updates of the review. The following paragraph was added to the end of the discussion section:
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Our search strategy incorporated a wide range of commonly used keywords and phrases related to direct-to-consumer genetic testing, we did however not include MeSH terms such as &#8220;Direct-To-Consumer Screening&#8221;. Including these terms may have improved search sensitivity in certain databases. Future updates of this review might incorporate these MeSH terms to enhance the precision and comprehensiveness of the search strategy.&#8221;</italic>
</p><p> The time frame of the analyses is a little hard to identify for each study and may have a strong association with the likelihood of information sharing and medical follow-up. When available, information regarding the follow-up duration was included in Table 3. However, this information was not reported in all the studies included in our systematic review. We have addressed this limitation by incorporating the following paragraph into the Discussion section:
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Variability in follow-up duration across studies may have influenced the observed rates of information sharing and medical follow-up, as participants with longer follow-up periods may have had more opportunities to act upon the information received. However, detailed information on the exact timing of follow-up was not consistently available across all studies, limiting our ability to adjust for this factor. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting cross-study comparisons.&#8221;</italic> In analyses of data from the Scripps Genomic Health Initiative, health care utilization was assessed as follows: &#8220;13 health screening behaviours were assessed by asking</p><p> about actual completion of a given screening test&#8230;&#8221; Are the authors sure that they&#8217;re summarizing data about health care utilization motivated by DTC-GT findings? Some of those services (e.g., glucose exam, blood test, mammogram) are common for patients as part of overall preventive care. We understand the concern raised by the reviewer; however, we would like to emphasize that the results reported in our systematic review specifically focus on the validation of DTC-GT results and the subsequent clinical actions taken based on those results. We did not include any screening behaviors that may be part of general preventive care, as described by the reviewer, in our results section. Minor Issues The manuscript starts with a focus on monogenic disease risks and risk predictions and feels out-of-focus with the majority of their analyses which address broader range of DTC-GTs. We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s observation. Our intention in the introductory paragraph was to provide context for the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) by outlining the broader evolution of genetic and genomic medicine&#8212;from its initial focus on rare monogenic disorders to its expansion into complex disease risk prediction. However, we recognize that this framing may have inadvertently implied a narrower scope than was intended. To address this, we have revised the introduction to more accurately reflect the full range of health-related DTC-GT examined in our review. In the Introduction, the authors write, &#8220;The reliability of a positive test or increased risk result after DTC-GT remains limited, as the development of many genetic conditions is also influenced by other factors such as the environment and lifestyle choices.&#8221; I encourage the authors to address some of the challenges they address later in the manuscript related to high rates of analytic false positives, as well as concerns about potential misinterpretations of uninformative findings as negatives for genetic risk factors. We have indeed briefly addressed the challenges related to analytic false positives and the potential for misinterpretation of uninformative findings in the manuscript. However, as the primary aim of our review is to assess sharing behaviors, healthcare professional experiences, and healthcare utilization following DTC-GT, an in-depth exploration of these technical and interpretive limitations lies beyond its scope. We believe these issues have been comprehensively addressed in previous literature, and our focus remains on the downstream clinical and behavioral impacts of DTC-GT results. In Table 3A, the cell &#8220;Shared with HCP (=yes)&#8221; looks like it should have slightly different content and formatting. We are not entirely sure what is meant by the comment regarding the content and formatting of the &#8220;Shared with HCP (=yes)&#8221; cell in Table 3A. To clarify, this column was not intended to serve as an overarching header for the adjacent columns. In some studies, only a general percentage of participants who shared results with &#8220;a healthcare provider&#8221; was reported, without further specification of provider type. We hope this explanation clarifies the presentation of the data.</p><p> Figures 2 and 3 would benefit from captions. I was unsure if lines represented medians across studies and x&#8217;s represent means. Also, some categories (genetic specialist, genetic counselor, medical geneticist) are not mutually exclusive. We have added a footnote explaining that for the boxplots shown, the line inside the box indicates the median value, whereas the &#8216;x&#8217; marks the mean. While we acknowledge that these categories are indeed not mutually exclusive, the primary studies included in our analysis varied considerably in how they defined and reported these roles. To maintain consistency and accuracy, we chose to adhere closely to the categorizations as originally presented in the source studies. The following footnote was added to the figures to clarify this:
<italic toggle="yes">&#8220;Categories are not mutually exclusive but were retained as defined in the original studies for consistency.&#8221;</italic> In one place, those authors write that the Stewart paper was published in 2017. Adjusted in the manuscript. The authors write, &#8220;Specifically, those who received subsidized or free tests were more likely to share their results, particularly to primary healthcare professionals, compared to those who paid out-of-pocket.&#8221; It may be helpful to understand whether those receiving subsidized or free tests were studies where testing was encouraged by researchers, and to note that individuals often pursue DTC-GT to avoid having results put in their medical records, as noted by the authors. We agree that understanding whether individuals who received subsidized or free tests were part of studies where testing was actively encouraged would provide valuable context. Unfortunately, the available data in the included studies do not consistently provide detailed information on the extent of such encouragement or on participants' motivations for pursuing testing. This limits our ability to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between subsidized testing and sharing behaviors. We have interpreted these findings with caution and noted the need for future research to explore how motivations influence result sharing and health care engagement. I don&#8217;t think the literature about the use of 3
<sup>rd</sup>&#160;party interpretation services is very relevant in the Introduction or Discussion, although I agree that the use of these services following DTC-GT is of great concern. We appreciate the concern regarding relevance; however, we believe that discussing these services in the Introduction and Discussion is important for several reasons. Third-party interpretation services have become a significant and growing component of the DTC-GT landscape, influencing how consumers understand and act upon their genetic results. DTC-GT users may turn to these services to seek additional explanation or clinical interpretation that may not be provided directly by DTC companies. This behavior has important implications for how genetic information is shared with family members and health care providers, as well as for subsequent health care utilization. By including this literature, we provide a more comprehensive view of the consumer experience and the broader context in which DTC-GT results are interpreted and acted upon. Omitting this could overlook a key factor shaping downstream behaviors and potential challenges in clinical integration. Therefore, we believe that maintaining the discussion of third-party interpretation services enhances the depth and relevance of our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article></article></pmc-articleset>
