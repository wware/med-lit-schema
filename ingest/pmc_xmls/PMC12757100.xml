Not only are these tumors unresponsive to receptor-targeted treatments, but&#160;also they typically manifest increased metastatic potential and invasiveness, high relapse rate, and poor outcomes. As such, there is a compelling clinical need for novel TNBC treatment regimens. A range of different therapeutic approaches are being investigated, including the use of immunotherapeutic agents. In this meta-analysis,&#160;we set out to evaluate the potential for using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), targeting either programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), in TNBC. A keyword search was performed using three databases, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, and PubMed, to identify potential studies to be included in a meta-analysis. Studies comparing the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with TNBC were identified. The data from all the eligible studies were extracted, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.</p><p>After filtering, six studies were included, containing a total of 4,824 patients. Four trials aimed to investigate the objective response rate (ORR), and three trials looked at the duration of response (DOR), all-cause adverse effects (AEs), and treatment-related adverse effects. The ORR was significantly higher in the PD-L1 inhibitor&#160;group (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.09-3.44; p &lt; 0.00001). Similarly, treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly increased the mean DOR (mean difference {MD}, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.74-3.18; p &lt; 0.00001). All-cause adverse events and treatment-related adverse events were both higher in the anti-PD-L1 groups (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 0.85-3.87, and p = 0.12 and OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.00-2.75, and p = 0.05, respectively). However, only treatment-related adverse events were significantly higher. This meta-analysis confirmed that regimens containing PD-1- or PD-L1-targeting agents have clinical utility and acceptable side-effect profiles when used in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.&#160;Future research should&#160;explore combination therapies to enhance efficacy and combat resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>atezolizumab</kwd><kwd>clinical outcomes</kwd><kwd>immune checkpoint inhibitors (icis)</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>pembrolizumab</kwd><kwd>triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>Breast cancer has consistently remained the most prevalent malignancy in women, affecting 2.3 million women worldwide in 2020, with 685,000 deaths recorded in the same year [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], a figure that has steadily increased since 2012 [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Significant improvement in overall survival (OS) has greatly stalled since 2015, so there is an urgent need for alternative treatments [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Breast tumor cells that lack the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the progesterone receptor (PR), and the estrogen receptor (ER) define&#160;a subgroup of breast cancer as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Improvements in response rates have been especially challenging to accomplish in the TNBC subgroup because these individuals have cancers with a strong metastatic potential, which leads to early recurrence rates and a poorer prognosis [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. TNBC is also more common in younger age groups [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Premenopausal women below the age of 40&#160;comprise 15%-20% of all patients with breast cancer [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Their survival time is shorter, with a five-year mortality rate of approximately 40% [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This contrasts with a 90% five-year survival for all breast cancer cases [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The difference in these expected outcomes highlights the need to develop more effective treatments for the population with TNBC.</p><p>TNBC has a high&#160;metastatic tendency due to its invasive nature, with around 46% of patients with TNBC developing a distant metastasis within three years of diagnosis. This contributes to an elevated post-surgery recurrence rate of 25% of distant metastasis, more often in the brain and visceral organs, and a median survival time of just 13.3 months&#160;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Relapse rates in&#160;patients without&#160;TNBC vary between 35 and 67 months, as opposed to the shorter period, i.e., 19-40 months in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, patients with TNBC experience a high mortality rate of around 75% within three months following disease recurrence [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In response to these poor clinical outcomes, several novel therapeutic strategies have been developed for the treatment of patients with TNBC&#160;(Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In fact, gene mutation studies revealed that <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> gene mutations and/or deficits are present in around 15%-20% of patients with TNBC, which is significant since these defects play a critical role in compromising DNA integrity and encouraging carcinogenesis [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, the outcomes of practice-altering clinical studies using the PARP inhibitors, olaparib and talazoparib, confirmed their efficacy in patient groups with&#160;TNBC [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In terms of immunotherapy, while the introduction of ICIs has completely changed how many solid cancers, including metastatic TNBC (mTNBC), are treated, their role in the neoadjuvant therapy setting is still not entirely understood [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. From a biological perspective, TNBC represents an immunogenic subtype of breast cancer since several preclinical studies have found that this disease has high levels of immune cell infiltrates and a high load of tumor mutations [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This should make them highly suited to immunotherapeutic interventions.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Classification and therapeutic options for TNBC</title><p>Image sourced from &#8220;Recent advances in therapeutic strategies for triple-negative breast cancer,&#8221;&#160;by Li Y, Zhang H, Merkher Y, Chen L, Liu N, Leonov S, Chen Y, 2022, J Hematol Oncol, 15(1), 121 [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] under Creative Commons Attribution License CC BY 4.0 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0" ext-link-type="uri">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0</ext-link>/).

Early-stage tumors may undergo breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy, often followed by adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce recurrence risk. For patients with <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations and specific tumor characteristics, such as larger size or lymph node involvement, olaparib may be added post-chemotherapy to improve outcomes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, sometimes with pembrolizumab, is used to shrink tumors before surgery, followed by additional treatments if residual cancer remains. In stage IV TNBC, initial therapy typically involves chemotherapy, with options such as anthracyclines, taxanes, or combinations thereof. Immunotherapy, particularly pembrolizumab for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive cancers, may be considered early in treatment. For refractory cases, PARP inhibitors or antibody-drug conjugates such as sacituzumab govitecan provide alternative options. Clinical trial participation is encouraged across all stages to explore novel therapies due to TNBC&#8217;s challenging prognosis and limited treatment options compared to other breast cancer types [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Immunotherapy for TNBC</p><p>TNBC is a good candidate for immunotherapeutic treatments, primarily because of tumor immune infiltration, neoantigens caused by higher genomic instability, and mutational burden, as well as high expression levels of immune checkpoint markers such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These&#160;are highly correlated with tumor response, relapse, and overall outcomes [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immunotherapy has shown success in a variety of neoplasms; consequently, immunotherapeutic approaches against TNBC offer great potential [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The first monoclonal antibody (mAb) licensed for TNBC, atezolizumab, was given FDA approval in 2019&#160;for patients with metastatic TNBC that is unresectable, locally progressive, and positive for PD-L1. In 2020, the FDA additionally authorized the use of the anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, when used in conjunction with chemotherapy for patients with similar indications with a combined positive score (CPS) of &#8805;10&#160;[<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In some solid tumors, high expression levels of the PD-L1 and PD-1 immune checkpoint molecules are known therapeutic targets [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. According to reports, PD-1/PD-L1 are often expressed in breast tumors, particularly TNBC [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As PD-L1 from cancer cells may bind PD-1 on T cells, enabling cancer cells to avoid T cell-mediated immune recognition, PD-L1, PD-L2, and PD-1 are significant ICI molecules. Therefore, reactivating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with monoclonal antibodies can have beneficial therapeutic consequences in a variety of cancers, not just TNBC [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. TNBC shows higher genomic instability and has the greatest mutational frequency of all breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it may also produce neoantigens that may be detected by the immune system. These characteristics suggest that TNBC may be particularly amenable to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p>Phase II and III trials have evaluated the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy. In particular, two key studies, the KEYNOTE-522 [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the IMpassion031 [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], showed that the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy considerably enhanced the pathological complete response (pCR) as compared to chemotherapy alone [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it should be noted that a proportion of patients do not benefit from these strategies, as evidenced by the results of the GeparNuevo and NeoTRIP trials, which failed to meet their primary end points [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the role of neoadjuvant ICIs, including the absence of accurate predictors of response to TNBC immunotherapy. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), the duration of response (DOR), and adverse events in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating ICIs (atezolizumab and pembrolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy for patients with metastatic TNBC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Methodology</p><p>Aim of the Study</p><p>Immune checkpoint&#160;inhibitors in combination with neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be effective in multiple types of advanced cancers.

Consequently, they were assessed for eligibility and full-text screening, which led to the inclusion of six studies&#160;with a total of 4,824 participants [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the total population varied for each outcome based on the reporting by the trials. The quality assessment of included studies is summarized in Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.</p><p>Study Characteristics</p><p>The patient characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A pooled total of 4,824 patients was included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The trials were published between 2019 and 2021. Four trials aimed to investigate the ORR, and three trials looked at DOR, adverse effects, and treatment-related adverse effects, which were also the primary end points of our study.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the included studies</title><p>Included studies are found in the column with characteristics in rows stated for intervention versus control [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</p><p>N, total population; n, subset population; ECOG,&#160;Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; PD-L1,&#160;programmed cell death ligand 1; ITT,&#160;intention to treat</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="4" rowspan="2">Characteristics of studies</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Narayan&#160;et al.

Our study confirms that immune checkpoint inhibitors, atezolizumab or pembrolizumab, targeting PD-1 or PD-L1, have beneficial effects for patients with TNBC, as evidenced by increased response rates and the prolonged duration of response.</p><p>The approval of targeted treatments, such as the PARP inhibitors olaparib and talazoparib [<xref rid="REF45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for the treatment of advanced or metastatic TNBC, has stimulated the growth of studies to investigate their therapeutic potential in early-stage disease [<xref rid="REF46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This underscores the importance of leveraging biomarker-driven strategies in treatment planning to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Despite this promise, the lack of standardized thresholds for PD-L1 expression complicates its use as a reliable predictor.&#160;ICIs such as pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have shown promising clinical efficacy in TNBC, with notable positive responses and survival rates for TNBC. Studies indicate median overall survival ranging from 11.2 to 18 months with pembrolizumab and 14.7 months with atezolizumab, along with ORR of up to 39.4% [<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Combination therapy has also significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and OS&#160;[<xref rid="REF49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These results emphasize the potential of checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of TNBC by demonstrating positive clinical anticancer activity when administered alone or in combination. Results from our meta-analysis also show a similar trend.</p><p>Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, demonstrated high specificity in binding to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells&#160;[<xref rid="REF50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="REF51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Atezolizumab was evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation trial (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT01375842">NCT01375842</ext-link>) involving patients with solid malignancies with PD-L1 expression and was found to be effective in 100% and without treatment-related AEs in 5% of the population. The ORR&#160;was 19%, including two complete responses (CRs), two partial responses (PRs), and three cases of stable disease (SD). In patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), atezolizumab was well-tolerated, and those with stable or responding disease and early treatment courses experienced sustained clinical benefits, consistent with our meta-analysis findings [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Contrary to expectations, high immune cell counts (&gt;10%) were independently linked to better ORR and better OS [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 on T cells, enhances immune responses by blocking the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and its ligand, PD-L1, found on tumor cells&#160;[<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="REF52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>-<xref rid="REF54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the non-randomized phase Ib multi-cohort trial KEYNOTE-01231, 58.6% of 111 patients with metastatic TNBC had PD-L1-positive tumors. Patients received a median of five doses (range: 1-36 doses) of pembrolizumab. Grade 3 toxicity affected five patients (15.6%), with one treatment-related mortality. Common toxicities included arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea. Median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range: 7.3-32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range: 15.0-47.3 weeks). The ORR&#160;among 27 evaluable patients was 18.5%&#160;[<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>First-line therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and atezolizumab shows higher response rates and longer OS compared to their use in second-line or advanced treatment settings. Pembrolizumab exhibits an ORR of 21.4% and an OS of 18 months in first-line therapy versus an ORR of 5.3% and an OS of nine months in subsequent treatments&#160;[<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="REF55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

These differences suggest potential evolution in TNBC and highlight challenges in maintaining immune response efficacy as treatment progresses, possibly due to tumor resistance mechanisms and chronic inflammation dynamics, which is referred to as &#8220;The Seventh Hallmark of Cancer,&#8221; overriding the positive effects of ICIs and decreasing their effectiveness [<xref rid="REF56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is associated with better treatment outcomes and immune evasion through cytotoxic T cell inhibition. In contrast, PD-L2, with higher binding affinity to PD-1, has significant clinical implications, especially in TNBC, where elevated PD-L2 bearing extracellular vesicle&#160;(PD-L2EV) levels correlate with worse survival outcomes. Both biomarkers should be considered independently for precise patient stratification and therapy optimization&#160;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="REF57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="REF58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].&#160;Recent studies highlight the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression in metastatic TNBC. A meta-analysis by Khan et al. demonstrated that PD-L1 expression strongly predicts objective response, one-year PFS, and two-year OS [<xref rid="REF59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].&#160;Similarly, Zhang et al. reported comparable pathological complete response (pCR) rates between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative groups, with longer PFS observed in the combination treatment group [<xref rid="REF60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Other studies, including a meta-analysis by Wang [<xref rid="REF61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and additional investigations, also highlight the close association between PD-L1 expression and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in TNBC treatment [<xref rid="REF62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="REF63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], emphasizing the importance of patient stratification based on PD-L1 status.</p><p>Several studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria showed similar findings when comparing pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy to placebo or chemotherapy alone, with significant and clinically meaningful improvements [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="REF55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="REF64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>-<xref rid="REF70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, some studies reported contrasting results. Miles et al. found no improvement in PFS&#160;or OS&#160;when paclitaxel was combined with atezolizumab [<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Gianni et al. reported no improvement in pathological complete response (pCR) with the addition of atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel, though PD-L1 expression was the key factor influencing pCR rates [<xref rid="REF63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Wang (2022) in a meta-analysis showed that the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had no significant effect on PFS or OS, but promising results were observed in the PD-L1-positive subgroup, where both PFS and OS improved significantly [<xref rid="REF61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Adverse effects and treatment-related side effects have been reported in various trials, making the side-effect profile an important consideration&#160;[<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="REF65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="REF66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="REF69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>-<xref rid="REF71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Poor clinical prognostic factors, such as visceral disorders, liver metastases, multiple metastatic sites, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, are associated with reduced response to checkpoint inhibitors and rapid disease progression [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="REF55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To increase the therapeutic response rate in these contexts, alternative therapy approaches, as well as combination therapy, should be taken into account [<xref rid="REF55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors such as atezolizumab and pembrolizumab, added to comparator treatments, contribute to more adverse events, stemming from both typical side effects and those related to the additional medication. Most adverse events result from immune system activation by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) being of particular interest, consistent with previous studies on checkpoint inhibitors [<xref rid="REF72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="REF73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>This study&#8217;s strengths lie in its use of phase III trials and robust statistical methods&#160;and focus on two FDA-approved agents. Limitations include a small sample size, potential publication bias, and variability in treatment durations and control arms, which may impact generalizability. High heterogeneity in efficacy metrics reflects the complexity of TNBC and the need for personalized treatment approaches. This review adheres to a predefined search and analytic framework; therefore, additional post hoc literature updates, sensitivity analyses, and statistical expansions were not undertaken. Despite these limitations, the findings suggest that PD-1/PD-L1-targeting treatments are promising for TNBC, warranting further large-scale randomized controlled trials.</p><p>Future research should standardize treatment protocols, identify biomarkers, and explore combination therapies to enhance efficacy and combat resistance. Genomic profiling and long-term studies are needed for deeper insights into mechanisms and survival. Investigating immune checkpoint inhibitors in early-stage TNBC, alongside therapies such as PARP inhibitors, may improve outcomes. Emerging technologies can reveal the tumor microenvironment&#8217;s role in resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have a great deal of promise as a new treatment for TNBC, according to our systematic review and meta-analysis.
