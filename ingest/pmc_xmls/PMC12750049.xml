Protein sialylation serves an important role in maintaining the integrity of this barrier. The present study investigated how &#945;2,3-linked sialylation catalyzed by protein ST3Gal1 affected intestinal barrier function and impacted the pathogenesis of human ulcerative colitis (UC). The present study employed Caco-2, HT29-MTX-E12 and THP-1 cells with distinct functionalities to establish an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> triple-culture model. This model was utilized to simulate both healthy and inflamed states of the human intestine for investigating the impact of ST3Gal1-mediated &#945;2,3-sialylation on the integrity of the intestinal barrier. The triple-culture model was stably infected with adenoviral particles or lentiviral vectors to establish ST3Gal1 knockdown and overexpression, respectively, followed by isolation through incubation with 4 &#181;g/ml puromycin. The functionality of the intestinal barrier was assessed via trans-epithelial electrical resistance and FITC-dextran permeability assays. ST3Gal1 expression was found to be associated with inflammation of the intestinal mucosa in patients with UC and a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Notably, suppressed expression of ST3Gal1 in the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayer enhanced the functionality of the intestinal barrier, whereas its overexpression caused intestinal barrier function deterioration. ST3Gal1 expression in the IEC monolayer altered the expression of intestinal mucus barrier-associated mucin 2 (MUC2) and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), goblet cell differentiation-associated homeobox protein CDX-2 (CDX2), inflammation-associated phosphorylated (p)-STAT3, and the inflammatory mediators IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and IL-8. Specifically, MUC2, TFF3 and CDX2 were positively associated with enhanced barrier integrity, whereas p-STAT3, IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and IL-8 were negatively correlated with barrier function. Collectively, these results demonstrated a strong association between these factors and the regulation of intestinal barrier function. In conclusion, ST3Gal1-catalyzed &#945;2,3-linkage formation in IECs may be closely associated with intestinal barrier function via its effect on the expression of barrier-associated proteins and inflammatory mediators related to intestinal mucosa inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sialylation</kwd><kwd>barrier</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>ST3Gal1</kwd><kwd>triple culture model</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing</funding-source><award-id>cstc2020jcyj-msxmX1094</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The present work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (grant no. cstc2020jcyj-msxmX1094).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) comprise chronic as well as recurrent gastrointestinal conditions. A recent study has reported on the notable increase in the global prevalence of IBD, predominantly characterized by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (<xref rid="b1-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Impaired intestinal barrier integrity is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of IBD and is closely associated with its pathophysiology (<xref rid="b2-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Despite this, there is a characteristic lack of therapeutic options that specifically enhance mucosal barrier function and promote its regeneration in IBD, which is likely owing to a limited understanding of the underlying biological pathways and regulatory molecules involved (<xref rid="b4-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although various potential therapeutic approaches have been developed for improving mucosal barrier function (<xref rid="b4-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, no regenerative strategies have yet been developed specifically for IBD.</p><p>Glycosylation is a post-translational modification affecting proteins, lipids and RNA, which can profoundly influence the structural and functional characteristics of the modified molecules (<xref rid="b6-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b8-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This modification is important for regulating a variety of biological mechanisms, including protein maturation, transport and immune modulation (<xref rid="b9-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Glycosylation is also implicated in the pathophysiology of severe diseases, such as during carcinogenesis, and inflammation; a previous study also demonstrated its association with IBD (<xref rid="b10-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In healthy individuals, protein glycoforms exhibit substantial stability over time; however, they tend to undergo notable alterations in response to pathological conditions, particularly during inflammatory states. For example, patients diagnosed with IBD exhibit increased expression levels of short-chain O-glycans in the intestine compared with healthy individuals, accompanied by alterations in the expression of terminal glycan structures (for example, increased sialylation, enhanced fucosylation, reduced sulfation and dysregulated Lewis antigens). These changes adversely affect the integrity of the intestinal mucus layer, impede glycan-lectin interactions, disrupt the dynamic balance of the intestinal microbiota and impair the functionality of the intestinal mucosal immune system (<xref rid="b11-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Different sialylation modifications are catalyzed by various sialyltransferases. However, any alterations in the expression levels of sialyltransferases change their physiological functions. For example, a decrease in sialyltransferase ST6GalNAc1 (ST6)-catalyzed &#945;2,6-sialylation in mice results in impaired mucus barrier function, gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation (<xref rid="b12-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The &#945;2,6-sialylation catalyzed by ST6Gal1 promotes the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and induces the development of UC (<xref rid="b13-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), whereas &#945;2,8-sialylation catalyzed by ST8Sia4 facilitates the metastasis of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="b14-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the role of ST3Gal1-catalyzed &#945;2,3-sialylation in intestinal inflammation remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p>The upregulation of ST3Gal1 augments the sialylation of O-glycan Tn and catalyzes its conversion into sialyl-Tn. This modification introduces an &#945;2,3-linkage between Gal and &#946;1,3-GalNAc, which is frequently observed in various cancer types, including breast cancer and hematological malignancies, where the upregulation of sialyltransferases leads to premature termination of aberrant mucin-type O-glycan chains (<xref rid="b15-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Notably, mucin-type O-linked glycosylation is not restricted to mucins; this modification also occurs in an array of cell-surface glycoproteins (<xref rid="b17-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Emerging evidence has highlighted that glycosylation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is associated with specific glycosyltransferases; however, the functional role of ST3Gal1-catalyzed &#945;2,3-sialylation, a key glycosylation event mediated by this glycosyltransferase, in the regulation of intestinal barrier function has often been neglected in relevant research. Dysregulation of glycosylation exacerbates intestinal inflammation by damaging the intestinal barrier integrity, interfering with glycan-lectin interactions, disrupting intestinal microbiota dynamics and impairing mucosal immunity (<xref rid="b18-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b20-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Given that ST3Gal1-catalyzed &#945;2,3-linkage formation at the end of N-glycan or O-glycan is associated with carcinogenesis, as well as a host of other diseases, it is necessary to evaluate prognostic factors, identify predictive biomarkers and explore possible therapeutic targets associated with ST3Gal1 activity, particularly in IBD (<xref rid="b15-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b21-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, there is limited research on ST3Gal1 and its impact on the function of the intestinal barrier.</p><p>The present study aimed to explore the potential role of ST3Gal1-catalyzed &#945;2,3-linkage in IBD, along with its underlying mechanisms. The present experimental study employed an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> triple-cell co-culture system to replicate both the healthy and inflamed states of the human intestine to investigate the impact of ST3Gal1-mediated &#945;2,3-sialylation on the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier function. Notably, in the present model, each cell type embodied distinct roles: i) Caco-2 cells formed a monolayer that mimicked IECs; ii) HT29-MTX-E12 cells secreted mucus and acted as a surrogate for intestinal goblet cells; and iii) THP-1 cells, upon induction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), differentiated into macrophage-like cells, simulating intestinal inflammatory cells (<xref rid="b22-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b24-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

All cells were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling and were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Merck KGaA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone&#8482;; Cytiva). Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37&#176;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture model</title><p>To establish an IEC monolayer, Caco-2 and HT29-MTX-E12 cells were co-seeded at a total density of 8&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well into the apical compartment of 24-well Transwell inserts (pore size, 0.4 &#181;m; Wuxi NEST Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at a ratio of 9:1, based on this ratio and total cell density, the seeding number of Caco-2 cells was 7.2&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well, and that of HT29-MTX-E12 cells was 8&#215;10<sup>3</sup> cells/well, followed by a differentiation period of 19 days. Concurrently, the culture medium was replaced three times a week to maintain optimal growth conditions. Additionally, THP-1 cells were stimulated to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by applying PMA (100 ng/ml; Beyotime Biotechnology) at 37&#176;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 h in 24-well plates. Subsequently, the differentiated macrophage-like THP-1 cells were cultured in the basolateral compartment of the same Transwell plate. The IEC monolayer and macrophage-like THP-1 cells were co-cultured for 24 h under standard conditions (37&#176;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) to simulate the intestinal mucosa <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>ST3Gal1 overexpression (ST3Gal1-OE) assay</title><p>Lentiviral vectors designed for the overexpression of ST3Gal1 were procured from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. The ST3Gal1-OE lentiviral vector was constructed using the LV5(EF-1&#945;/CopGFP&amp;Puro) backbone, based on the 3rd-generation lentiviral system, with a working concentration of 1&#215;10<sup>10</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. The lentiviral particles were produced by transfecting 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection). For transfection, a total of 10 &#181;g plasmids was used, and the molar ratio of lentiviral expression plasmid (ST3Gal1-OE)/packaging plasmid/envelope plasmid was 4:3:1. The transfection was performed using Lipofectamine<sup>&#174;</sup> 3000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, under the conditions of 37&#176;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for a duration of 48 h to facilitate lentivirus production. The negative control for overexpression experiments was an empty LV5 vector (Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd.), used at the same concentration (1&#215;10<sup>10</sup> PFU/ml).</p><p>Following the precise guidelines set forth by the manufacturer, infection of the cells in the triple co-culture model was performed within the Transwell system, with lentiviral vectors added to both the upper and lower chambers. For lentiviral transduction, polybrene (Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd.) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 5 &#181;g/ml to enhance infection efficiency, and the lentiviral particles were used at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The infected cells were then incubated at 37&#176;C for 24 h. Subsequently, 4 &#181;g/ml puromycin (MilliporeSigma; Merck KGaA) was used for the initial selection of stably infected cell lines for 7 days, followed by maintenance with 2 &#181;g/ml puromycin thereafter. These cell lines were subsequently classified as OE-Ctr/IEC (negative control group) and ST3Gal1-OE/IEC groups. Cells were collected on day 9 post-infection (after the completion of the 1-day infection plus a 7-day selection process), and the successful overexpression of ST3Gal1 was confirmed through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>ST3Gal1 interference assay</title><p>Adenoviral particles designed for interfering with the ST3Gal1 enzyme were obtained from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd.

The adenoviral particles were produced by transfecting 293T cells. For transfection, 10 &#181;g plasmids were used per 10-cm culture dish, and the molar ratio of adenoviral expression plasmid (ST3Gal1-sh or sh-Ctr)/packaging plasmid/envelope plasmid was 1:1:1. The transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions, at 37&#176;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 h before collecting the adenoviral supernatant.</p><p>The triple co-culture cells cultured within the Transwell system were infected with these adenoviral particles in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines, with adenoviral particles added to both the upper and lower chambers of the Transwell system. The infection procedure was consistent with that used for the infection of overexpression lentiviral vectors aforementioned. These cell lines were subsequently classified as sh-Ctr/IEC and ST3Gal1-sh/IEC groups. The working concentration of adenovirus particles carrying interfering fragments was 1&#215;10<sup>10</sup> PFU/ml, and that of negative control adenovirus particles was 1&#215;10<sup>10</sup> PFU/ml. For adenoviral infection, the MOI was set at 40.

Briefly, total RNA was extracted from triple co-culture cells, including ST3Gal1-sh, ST3Gal1-OE and their respective negative control cells, using the RNA Isolation Kit (MilliporeSigma; Merck KGaA). RNA purity was assessed by evaluating the A260/A280 ratio (1.8&#8211;2.0) with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). RNA integrity was verified through 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), obtaining an RNA integrity number &gt;8.0. cDNA synthesis was performed using the PrimeScript&#8482; RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

ST3Gal1 knockdown in the IEC monolayer increased the barrier function, whereas its overexpression resulted in intestinal barrier function deterioration. Overexpression of ST3Gal1 in the IEC monolayer reduced the expression of intestinal mucus barrier-associated MUC2, TFF3 and CDX2, as well as the expression of inflammation-associated p-STAT3. By contrast, overexpression of ST3Gal1 elevated the levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IL-8), which are important for maintaining intestinal mucosa homeostasis (<xref rid="b33-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The DSS-induced colitis model is linked to the inflammatory status of the colonic tissue, as evidenced by the dynamic association between disease progression and the expression profiles of key molecules: Specifically, inflammatory factors (IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8), goblet cell secretory proteins (MUC2, TFF3) and signaling pathway-related proteins (STAT3, p-STAT3). This is supported by the bioinformatics analysis of the GEO dataset GDS3859, where ST3Gal1 mRNA expression in mouse colonic mucosa was significantly upregulated with prolonged DSS treatment (peaking at 6 days post-administration), concurrent with the exacerbation of colonic inflammation. Additionally, in the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> inflamed triple-culture model induced by 2% DSS, the expression patterns of the aforementioned molecules were consistently altered in response to ST3Gal1 knockdown or overexpression, further confirming that the DSS-induced model recapitulates the intrinsic association between colonic inflammatory status and the expression of these functional proteins in UC. ST3Gal1 facilitates the formation of &#945;2,3-sialic acid residues and contributes to the modification of glycan ends on proteins that possess &#945;2,3-sialic acid residues (<xref rid="b34-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

The present study elucidated the role of ST3Gal1 in various IEC monolayers, including inflamed and non-inflamed states, to identify knowledge gaps, and explore its potential application as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.</p><p>Sialyltransferases are key enzymes in the regulatory mechanisms of various life processes, including cell signaling, cellular recognition, interactions between cells and pathogens, and cancer metastasis (<xref rid="b36-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b38-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Among these enzymes, the ST3Gal family stands out as one of the most important enzyme families, comprising six distinct members in both mice and humans: ST3Gal1-6 (<xref rid="b39-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The ST3Gal family catalyzes the synthesis and attachment of &#945;2,3-linked sialic acid residues to the terminal galactose residues of glycans in proteins through a process known as sialylation. The evolution of distinct human ST3Gal family members, which establish specific &#945;2,3-linkages, suggests a degree of functional specialization; however, the roles of &#945;2,3-linkage in health and disease remain insufficiently investigated (<xref rid="b39-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Prior research has documented increased sialylation in IBD, as well as in other autoimmune conditions and instances of acute inflammation (<xref rid="b40-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Notably, &#945;2,6- and &#945;2,3-sialylation of glycans with extensively branched structures appear to escalate during inflammatory responses in CD and UC, respectively, which are mediated by &#945;2,6-sialyltransferases and &#945;2,3-sialyltransferases (<xref rid="b41-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Similarly, ST6 mutations in animal models have been shown to cause impairment of the intestinal mucus barrier, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation (<xref rid="b11-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b43-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Therefore, it can be suggested that ST6 is important for inhibiting bacterial translocation and mitigating inflammation within the intestinal mucus barrier (<xref rid="b44-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Consequently, the role of &#945;2,3-linkage, catalyzed by ST3Gal1 sialyltransferases, in the pathogenesis of patients with IBD and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored.</p><p>IBD refers to a persistent inflammatory disorder affecting the intestines, which is influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, immune responses and environmental elements (<xref rid="b45-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). To facilitate research on IBD, 66 distinct animal models have been developed at present, which can be classified into chemical treatment models, cell migration models, gene mutation models and gene transfer models (<xref rid="b46-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, in some mouse models with few IBD-related genes, the specific pathogenic mechanisms of IBD are more complex than previously predicted (<xref rid="b46-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches of IBD under healthy conditions and inflammatory microenvironments, respectively, researchers have established tri-culture cell models of healthy and inflamed states <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Based on these models, various complex <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> culture systems and derivative systems have been developed, including primary cell organoid culture systems, multicellular co-culture systems and chip device systems (<xref rid="b24-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b47-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The present study established an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> intestinal barrier simulation model by co-culturing three cell lines: i) HT29-MTX-E12 cells, which exhibit goblet cell characteristics and have a mucus-secreting ability, can be used to simulate the intestinal mucus layer <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>; ii) Caco-2 cells with epithelial cell properties, which were seeded in the upper layer; and iii) differentiable THP-1 inflammatory cells, which were seeded in the basal side. Subsequently, this model was treated with 2% DSS to induce an inflammatory state. The effect of ST3Gal on the integrity of the IEC monolayer barrier was then evaluated by measuring TEER and FITC-dextran permeability. Additionally, as reported in previous studies, the secretion levels of relevant inflammatory factors and the expression of intestinal barrier-related proteins were compared between inflammatory and non-inflammatory states (<xref rid="b49-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b51-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The tri-culture system designed to simulate intestinal conditions streamlined the present model, enhancing its robustness and reproducibility (<xref rid="b24-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The epithelial Transwell cultures incorporating Caco-2 and HT29-MTX-E12 cell lines exhibited traits that closely resemble those of human intestinal mucosal epithelium. Furthermore, the inclusion of immune-competent THP-1 cells contributed to the immune mechanisms associated with the development of IBD (<xref rid="b21-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Notably, both the presence of these immune effector cells and the persistence of inflammatory processes substantially influenced the sensitivity of the IEC monolayer.</p><p>However, there remains a lack of &#945;2,3-sialylation-linked target molecules bridging ST3Gal1 and intestinal mucus barrier-associated MUC2, TFF3 and CDX2, as well as inflammation-associated molecules, such as IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8, STAT3 and p-STAT3. Further study is required to identify ST3Gal1-mediated molecules with post-translation &#945;2,3-sialylation at their glycan termini. This may help identify novel target molecules to modulate the intestinal epithelial barrier function important for the pathogenesis of human IBD.</p><p>The present study provided a new direction for the treatment of UC and other IBDs and showed that ST3Gal1 can act as a potential therapeutic target. Overexpression of ST3Gal1 was directly associated with impaired intestinal barrier function, elevated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and IL-8, and increased disease activity in patients with UC, supported by <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and clinical data: i) <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, ST3Gal1 overexpression in the inflamed triple-culture model showed significantly reduced TEER, increased FITC-dextran permeability, downregulated expression of barrier-protective proteins MUC2, TFF3 and CDX2, and upregulated p-STAT3, as well as elevated mRNA and protein levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-6 and IL-8. ii) Clinically, bioinformatics analysis of GEO datasets (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE107499">GSE107499</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE92415">GSE92415</ext-link>) revealed that ST3Gal1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lesional vs. non-lesional mucosa inpatients with UC, it was positively associated with modified Mayo scores (a measure of UC disease activity), and it was positively correlated with the mRNA levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8 and STAT3 in UC lesional tissues. By contrast, ST3Gal1 knockdown upregulated the barrier-protective molecules (MUC2, TFF3 and CDX2) and reduced p-STAT3 expression, thereby repairing the mucosal barrier and alleviating inflammation. Compared with traditional broad-spectrum immunosuppressive therapies, ST3Gal1-targeted interventions may act precisely on the glycosylation pathway, thereby potentially minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, the characteristic high expression of ST3Gal1 in inflamed mucosal tissues enables it to serve as a potential biomarker for assessing disease activity or treatment response. Future studies should validate the efficacy of ST3Gal1 inhibitors in animal models or explore their synergistic effects with existing drugs, such as mesalamine, to provide more precise therapeutic options for IBD.</p><p>While the Caco-2/HT29-MTX-E12/THP-1 triple-culture model recapitulated key intestinal mucosal features and followed the 3R principles, it failed to fully replicate the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> intestinal microenvironment, lacking fibroblasts, endothelial cells and diverse gut microbiota, which are all regulators of mucosal barrier function and IBD inflammation (<xref rid="b52-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Furthermore, immortalized cell lines such as those used in the present study may not reflect the phenotypes or functions of primary cells of patients with IBD, thus limiting translational relevance.</p><p>The clinical analyses of the present study, which relied on retrospective GEO data, also had inherent constraints: i) The lack of access to detailed patient metadata, such as age and treatment history, or long-term paired samples, which would preclude ST3Gal1-prognosis/treatment response analyses; and ii) limited sample sizes of subgroups, such as the UC non-inflamed mucosa group, reduced the power of the correlation analysis for ST3Gal1 with MUC2, which as a key intestinal mucosal barrier component and goblet cell marker, is closely implicated in UC pathogenesis (<xref rid="b53-mmr-33-2-13783" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). To address these limitations, future studies should: i) Validate the findings of the present study by using primary IEC-organoid models with microbiota or stromal cells for improved physiological relevance; ii) use prospective, well-characterized clinical cohorts to clarify the clinical utility of ST3Gal1; and iii) apply glycoproteomic methods, such as lectin affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry, to identify ST3Gal1-mediated &#945;-2,3-sialylation target molecules to strengthen the mechanistic and translational value of the present results.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study provided evidence that ST3Gal1-catalyzed &#945;2,3-linkage formation in IEC may be closely associated with intestinal barrier function. This relationship could be mediated through the distinct influence of ST3Gal1 on the expression of intestinal barrier-associated proteins, including MUC2, TFF3 and CDX2, which are important for preserving the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Additionally, ST3Gal1 modulated the expression of associated inflammatory mediators and transcription factors, including the expression of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8 and STAT3, which serve important roles in regulating intestinal mucosal inflammation, thereby further linking ST3Gal1 to barrier function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The data generated in the present study may be requested from the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YT, YL, YS, LR and LL were responsible for performing the experiments, and collecting and analyzing the data; specifically, they performed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell culture (triple-culture model establishment, ST3Gal1 overexpression/knockdown), functional assays (TEER, FITC-dextran permeability), molecular experiments (RT-qPCR, western blotting, ELISA), and bioinformatics data processing (GEO dataset analysis).
