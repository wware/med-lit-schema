</sup> Despite thyroid carcinoma being the seventh most common cancer globally,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> a large proportion of thyroid nodules are found incidentally in asymptomatic patients and represent benign disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Determining which nodules are clinically relevant poses a challenge to both clinicians and their patients.</p><p>The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology classifies biopsy results into 1 of 6 cytopathologic categories, of which clear management algorithms exist for cytologically benign nodules, and those that are either suspicious for malignancy, or malignant. Conversely, nodules showing atypia of undetermined significance (AUS, Bethesda-III) or follicular neoplasm (FN, Bethesda-IV) are considered indeterminate in their risk for malignancy, with rates of 13% to 30% and 23% to 34%, respectively.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="bibr7-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> Physicians and patients are faced with a difficult decision following the diagnosis of AUS/FN, which has been shown to cause significant decisional conflict (DC) and uncertainty in patients.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> Shared decision-making (SDM) is an approach that encourages patient and physician involvement in medical decision-making.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr9-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> SDM is especially important in situations where multiple treatment options are feasible, such as with indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs). Patient-perceived SDM improves trust, satisfaction, and understanding while reducing DC.<sup>

</sup></p><p>Suboptimal involvement of patients and their physicians in discussions where there is clinical equipoise may generate further DC. Determining whether SDM is performed in the setting of ITNs may help identify the need for future interventions to support the decision-making process. The purpose of this study was to investigate perceived and objective SDM involvement in patients with ITNs during their initial consultation with an Otolaryngologist&#8212;Head and Neck Surgeon, and to evaluate the relationship between these outcomes and perceived DC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section12-19160216251407670"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section13-19160216251407670"><title>Design</title><p>This was a multi-institutional, cross-sectional, multiple methods study.

</sup> This is the first study to investigate both perceived and objective SDM involvement for ITNs and to validate the MAPPIN&#8217;SDM as an observer-based tool in this context. Perceived SDM was high for both patients and physicians, yet objective SDM was low. Despite overall low levels of DC experienced by patients, there is a subset of patients that still struggle.</p><p>Although self-reported measures (SDM-Q-9/SDM-Q-Doc) capture satisfaction with the SDM process, they may not reflect the overall quality of SDM behaviors during healthcare interactions<sup><xref rid="bibr30-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>&#8212;an area targetable for future improvement. While patient satisfaction is important, high self-report scores may not adequately reflect the complexity of SDM, including whether important information required for informed decision-making was discussed. Future researchers may therefore consider integrating both subjective and objective data for a more accurate evaluation of SDM.</p><p>Perceptions of SDM were higher in patients compared to physicians, likely due to better clinician knowledge on judging SDM performance. These findings are consistent with the literature. For example, a recent study involving 42 patients with non-cutaneous head and neck cancers found that both patients and surgeons reported relatively high perceived SDM scores, while observer-based scores were moderate in comparison.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr32-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</sup> In our study, post hoc analyses found no associations between DC and physician-perceived nor observer-determined SDM, suggesting that patient-experienced DC is more dependent on patient-perceived SDM. No associations were found between perceptions of SDM and age, sex, education level, ethnicity, income, or attending surgeon. There is, however, evidence in the literature that significant variations in management decisions exist for ITNs, including as a function of individual surgeons.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr33-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup> This may not be represented in our study considering interactions were video-recorded. Video-recorded interactions increase understanding about communication during clinical encounters;<sup><xref rid="bibr34-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> however, the awareness of being recorded may modify patient and physician behavior during clinical interactions (Hawthorne effect).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr36-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</sup> Importantly, analyses of associations were exploratory in nature; therefore, larger studies are required for validation.</p><p>In this study, 13% of patients experienced clinically significant DC. In a study involving 35 patients, one-third experienced clinically significant DC when deciding between management options for ITNs.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> Similarly, the current study found that higher levels of perceived SDM involvement are associated with lower levels of DC, suggesting that patients who feel actively engaged in their healthcare decisions experience less uncertainty about their treatment decision.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr37-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</sup> Importantly, to encourage patient participation in decision-making, an effective physician-patient relationship is required.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr38-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</sup> This exemplifies the need to optimize SDM when multiple feasible treatment options exist, including ITNs.</p><p>This is the first study to validate the MAPPIN&#8217;SDM in the context of ITNs. The MAPPIN&#8217;SDM demonstrated adequate reliability and validity, showing its appropriate use in this setting and future research, while further adding to the evidence collected from other clinical scenarios.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr23-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> This is one of few studies that has assessed both intra- and inter-rater reliability, which were found to be excellent and moderate, respectively. Although the MAPPIN&#8217;SDM requires training with a standardized manual, scoring may still differ between coders due to differences in interpretation of communication behaviors or variability in clinical experience with decision-making in this context. The results of this study could be strengthened with more trained observers.</p><p>The MAPPIN&#8217;SDM demonstrated that physicians and patient-physician dyads both scored highest on &#8220;defining the problem&#8221;; conversely, patients scored lowest on this item. This is understandable considering patients are often unaware of their diagnosis prior to the initial surgical consultation, and management discussions are ultimately guided by FNA biopsy results that have not yet been disclosed. Patients scored highest on &#8220;describing expectations and concerns,&#8221; which may reflect the high levels of patient-reported DC. Physicians and patient-physician dyads both scored lowest on &#8220;choosing a preferred communication approach&#8212;visual aids, written information, or involving another family member in the discussion.&#8221; This may reflect physician time constraints or simply the lack of decisional tools that exist for patients in the context of ITNs.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Patient-perceived SDM measurements endured ceiling effects, which made differentiation challenging and may explain the limited small association found between higher perceived SDM and lower DC. Physician-patient interactions occasionally preceded discussions with other healthcare team members (eg, surgical resident/fellow), potentially introducing variation into the healthcare experience. Additionally, patient-physician consultation lengths varied between clinicians, ranging from 5 to 30&#8201;minutes; longer interactions may permit more comprehensive management discussions. Importantly, although offered to all patients, molecular testing is not publicly funded in Canada, which may reflect its poor uptake in this study.</p><p>Elective surgeries were postponed at both sites during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in longer wait times for diagnostic hemithyroidectomies. This may have influenced participants&#8217; decisions, considering surgeons were often able to see patients sooner with ultrasound surveillance compared to surgery. One study found that during the pandemic there was a significant reduction in surgeries for ITNs, along with an increased occurrence of aggressive thyroid tumors.<sup>

</sup> Although most ITNs are benign, this suggests there may be a malignant transformational potential not accounted for.</p><p>A recent study by Scappaticcio et al highlights the complexity of decision-making in the setting of ITNs, emphasizing the incorporation of patient-specific factors, individual preferences, and nodal size in the SDM process.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr43-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
</sup> Currently, no decision-aids exist specifically for the management of ITNs. However, decision tools have proven to be helpful in the setting of thyroid nodules, prior to a cytological diagnosis. A pilot study evaluating the use of a web-based conversation aid to support SDM between patients with thyroid nodules and their physicians found significant improvements in observed SDM, and the decision tool was well-accepted.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-19160216251407670" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
