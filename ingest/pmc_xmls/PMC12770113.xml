The lack of targetable receptors excludes TNBC patients from hormone therapy and HER2-targeted treatments, resulting in the use of chemotherapy as the primary intervention, which is often associated with severe systemic toxicity and drug resistance. Albumin-based nanoplatforms have emerged as promising solutions to address these therapeutic challenges by exploiting the inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, extended circulation half-life, and natural tumor-targeting properties of albumin through interactions with gp60 and SPARC receptors that are overexpressed in TNBC tissues. This comprehensive review examines the molecular design principles, fabrication strategies, and targeting mechanisms of albumin nanocarriers, including passive targeting via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and active targeting through receptor&#8210;ligand interactions with uPAR, EGFR, CD44, CXCR4, and folate receptors. We analyze diverse therapeutic payloads, including conventional chemotherapeutics (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and docetaxel), natural products (curcumin and resveratrol), and molecular therapeutics (siRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9) delivered via albumin nanoplatforms. The clinical evidence supporting nab-paclitaxel in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors has demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival and objective response rates in PD-L1-positive mTNBC patients, whereas real-world studies have confirmed manageable safety profiles. However, several challenges remain, including drug loading limitations, nanocarrier stability under physiological conditions, interpatient variability in EPR effectiveness, potential immunogenicity of modified albumin, and the inherent molecular heterogeneity of TNBC subtypes, which may require personalized approaches. Future directions emphasize the development of multistimuli-responsive albumin nanocarriers, integration with gene editing and immunotherapy, artificial intelligence-guided design optimization, and precision medicine strategies tailored to individual tumor profiles. The convergence of the natural tumor affinity of albumin with advanced nanotechnology holds substantial promise for overcoming drug resistance, enhancing therapeutic specificity, and improving clinical outcomes in TNBC patients, positioning albumin-based nanomedicine as a transformative approach in precision oncology.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2">

The traditional classification system categorizes breast cancer into four subtypes on the basis of their hormone receptors (estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2), and breast cancer (TNBC)&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This molecular subclassification has significant implications for prognostic evaluation and therapy. Luminal A (ER&#8201;+&#8201;and/or PR&#8201;+&#8201;and HER2- low Ki-67) tumors usually have highly favorable outcomes and are responsive to endocrine therapy. Luminal B (ER&#8201;+&#8201;and/or PR&#8201;+&#8201;, HER2&#8201;+&#8201;or high Ki-67) tumors are more virulent and may need multimodal treatment with the addition of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Gene expression profiling has further established breast cancer heterogeneity by defining several distinct biological classes with differential survival profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Perou and coworkers initially showed via complementary DNA microarrays that breast tumors represent subtypes on the basis of their gene expression patterns, including luminal epithelial-like, basal-like, HER2-positive, and normal-like subgroups. Further studies have shown that these molecular subtypes correspond not only to distinct cells of origin but also to differentiated risk factors, metastatic patterns, and sensitivities to drugs, indicating the need for an individualized treatment approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is characterized by a lack of PR, ER and HER2 expression, accounts for approximately 12&#8211;20% of all breast cancers and is the most difficult type of cancer to manage. According to an epidemiological study, TNBC is unevenly distributed in women under 40&#160;years of age, especially African American women who have hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations. Compared with other subtypes, the biological landscape of TNBC is characterized by aggressive tumor behavior, with a higher histological grade, increased proliferative index, and distinctive metastatic patterns. From a molecular perspective, TNBC encompasses several distinct entities, including basal-like 1 and 2, mesenchymal, and luminal androgen receptor subtypes, each with unique molecular features and therapeutic vulnerabilities (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>Molecular characteristics, clinical features, genomic alterations, and therapeutic implications of key TNBC subtypes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Molecular subtype</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Key gene expression characteristics</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Genomic alterations</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clinical characteristics</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Therapeutic implications</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Frequency (%)</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Prognosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Basal-Like 1 (BL1)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Cell cycle and DNA damage response genes; Cell division pathways; BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction; High proliferation genes</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">TP53 mutations (high); BRCA1/2 mutations; RB1 loss; High genomic instability; DNA repair deficiency</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Higher grade; Lower stage; Younger age at diagnosis; Better overall survival among TNBC; Higher pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (41%)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">DNA-damage repair inhibitors; Cell cycle modulators; PARP inhibitors; Platinum-based chemotherapy; High cisplatin sensitivity</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">20&#8211;25%</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Intermediate to Good</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Basal-Like 2 (BL2)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Growth factor signaling (EGFR, NGF, MET, Wnt/&#946;-catenin); Myoepithelial markers; Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways; E2F2 and TGF&#946; signaling</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">TP53 mutations; PIK3CA mutations; Growth factor receptor alterations; High genomic instability</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Higher grade; Intermediate prognosis; Lower pCR rate (18%); May include metaplastic carcinomas</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">DNA alkylating agents; Growth factor receptor inhibitors; EGFR-targeted therapy; Standard chemotherapy</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">15&#8211;20%</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Poor to Intermediate</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Mesenchymal (M)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes; Cell motility and differentiation; Growth factor pathways; Angiogenesis signatures</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">TP53 mutations; EMT-related alterations; Angiogenesis pathway mutations; Stromal gene signatures</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Intermediate prognosis; Preferential lung metastasis; Variable response to chemotherapy; Associated with angiogenesis</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Anti-angiogenic agents; Kinase inhibitors; EMT pathway inhibitors; Stromal-targeting therapies</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">15&#8211;20%</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Poor to Intermediate</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par33">The&#160;clinical challenges&#160;associated with TNBC are substantial. Patients with TNBC experience more frequent and early recurrences, particularly within the first 3&#8211;5&#160;years after diagnosis, with a predilection for visceral metastases, including lung and brain involvement. The 5-year survival rate for TNBC patients is 8&#8211;16% lower than that for patients with hormone receptor-positive diseases, highlighting the urgent need for more effective therapeutic strategies. Notably, TNBC tumors represent only 8.2% of stage I cancers but constitute more than 15% of higher-stage diseases at diagnosis, indicating their aggressive nature and frequent late detection. Furthermore, the absence of established therapeutic targets excludes TNBC patients from receiving endocrine therapy or HER2-targeted agents, leaving conventional chemotherapy as the primary treatment option, to which many patients develop resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The current therapeutic arsenal for TNBC remains predominantly reliant on&#160;conventional modalities,&#160;including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and, more recently, immunotherapy, all of which present significant limitations.</p><p id="Par35">Chemotherapy, while serving as the cornerstone of TNBC treatment, has substantial shortcomings. Systemic chemotherapy agents (anthracyclines, taxanes, and platinum-based compounds) lack tumor-specific targeting ability, leading to widespread cytotoxic effects on rapidly dividing normal cells and consequent dose-limiting toxicities&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Common adverse effects include hematological suppression, neurotoxicity, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, and fatigue, which profoundly impact patients&#8217; quality of life&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, chemotherapy often confers only modest benefits in the metastatic setting, with response rates diminishing upon disease recurrence owing to the emergence of multidrug resistance mechanisms&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Long-term complications may include irreversible organ damage (cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity), secondary malignancies, and premature menopause with associated infertility and bone health concerns&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Radiotherapy, which is frequently employed in the locoregional management of TNBC, presents several challenges. While effective in reducing local recurrence rates, radiotherapy can induce significant cosmetic changes in the treated breast, including fibrosis, telangiectasia, and tissue contraction&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. More concerning are the potential late effects, which may manifest years after treatment completion. These include&#160;cardiac toxicity&#160;(with a linear increase in major coronary events of 7.4% per 1&#160;Gy of mean heart dose), pulmonary complications, and secondary malignancies such as lung cancer (with a rate ratio of 2.10&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;10&#160;years after radiation). The reconstructed breast poses additional challenges for radiotherapy planning and delivery, with increased rates of capsular contracture and compromised cosmetic outcomes&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a promising strategy for TNBC treatment. However, its efficacy remains limited to a subset of patients. ICIs such as atezolizumab and pembrolizumab demonstrate clinical activity primarily in PD-L1-positive TNBC, which represents only approximately 41% of the population&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Even in responsive patients, the absolute median survival benefit remains modest (approximately 2.5&#160;months in the IMpassion130 trial). Significant challenges include primary and acquired resistance mechanisms, immune-related adverse events, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and the lack of reliable predictive biomarkers beyond PD-L1 expression. Additionally, the combination of ICIs with chemotherapy necessitates careful consideration of steroid premedication, which may dampen the immune response&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Nanotechnology&#160;has emerged as a transformative approach to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapeutics. By exploiting the unique physicochemical properties of materials at the nanoscale (typically 1&#8211;100&#160;nm), nanocarriers can increase the solubility and stability of therapeutic agents, prolong their circulation half-life, and improve their biodistribution to target sites&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The&#160;enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoscale particles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to their leaky vasculature and impaired lymphatic drainage, provides a foundation for the passive targeting of nanotherapeutics&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Numerous nanoplatforms, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, inorganic nanoparticles, and protein-based nanocarriers, have been developed for cancer drug delivery. Each platform offers distinct advantages and limitations concerning loading capacity, stability, biocompatibility, and functionalization potential. Liposomal formulations&#160;(e.g., pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and&#160;antibody&#8210;drug conjugates&#160;(e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine, sacituzumab govitecan) represent some of the most clinically advanced nanotechnology-based approaches in breast cancer treatment&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These agents have the ability to improve the therapeutic index of conventional chemotherapeutics by enhancing antitumor efficacy while simultaneously reducing systemic exposure and associated toxicities&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The application of nanotechnology in TNBC treatment holds particular promise given the urgent need for more effective and targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanocarriers can be engineered to simultaneously deliver multiple therapeutic agents (e.g., chemotherapeutic drugs with immunomodulators) to address tumor heterogeneity and overcome resistance mechanisms&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, surface functionalization with targeting ligands (e.g., antibodies, peptides, and aptamers) can actively direct nanotherapeutics to tumor cells expressing specific surface markers, enhancing specificity and reducing off-target effects&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Among the various protein-based nanocarriers,&#160;albumin&#160;has emerged as a particularly promising platform for cancer drug delivery, especially in the context of TNBC. As a natural transport protein in human plasma, albumin offers several unique advantages as a drug delivery vehicle. Its inherent&#160;biocompatibility&#160;and&#160;biodegradability&#160;minimize the risk of adverse immune reactions and long-term accumulation concerns associated with synthetic carriers&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The naturally extended&#160;half-life&#160;(approximately 19&#160;days in humans) of albumin results from its size (66.5&#160;kDa) and interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which protects it from catabolism and facilitates recycling, thereby promoting prolonged circulation of albumin-bound therapeutics&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">The&#160;abundant binding sites&#160;on albumin allow for the noncovalent conjugation of a wide range of therapeutic agents, including hydrophobic chemotherapeutics (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel) and immunomodulatory compounds&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This binding capacity enables the efficient delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs without requiring harsh solubilizing excipients that often contribute to treatment-related toxicity (e.g., Cremophor EL in conventional paclitaxel formulations)&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The clinical validation of albumin as an effective drug carrier is exemplified by the success of&#160;nab-paclitaxel&#160;(albumin-bound paclitaxel, Abraxane&#174;), which has demonstrated superior efficacy and reduced toxicity compared with solvent-based paclitaxel in multiple cancer types, including TNBC&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">In addition to its role as a passive carrier, albumin appears to participate in&#160;active targeting mechanisms&#160;in TNBC. Many aggressive tumors, including TNBC, exhibit increased metabolism and nutrient demand, leading to increased albumin uptake via receptor-mediated pathways such as gp60 (albumin-binding glycoprotein) and SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine)&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. SPARC is particularly overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment of TNBC, potentially facilitating the accumulation of albumin-bound therapeutics within both tumor cells and stromal components&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The versatility of albumin as a platform enables the development of multifunctional nanocarriers that can simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic agents, immune modulators, and diagnostic contrast agents, facilitating theranostic applications. Furthermore, albumin nanoparticles can be surface modified with targeting ligands to increase their specificity for TNBC cells expressing specific surface markers (e.g., EGFR, CD44, or folate receptors)&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These unique properties position albumin-based nanoplatforms as particularly promising vehicles for addressing the numerous therapeutic challenges in TNBC, potentially overcoming drug resistance, reducing systemic toxicity, and improving overall treatment outcomes.</p><p id="Par45">Albumin-based delivery systems have already achieved significant clinical success, establishing a strong foundation for their continued development in oncology. The FDA-approved formulation Abraxane&#174; (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) exemplifies this approach, utilizing albumin to solubilize paclitaxel without toxic solvents such as Cremophor EL, thereby improving tolerability, enabling higher dose intensity, and reducing infusion times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

It has a secondary structure that consists of 67% alpha helices, 10% beta turns and 23% extended chains. Structurally, HSA is divided into three homologous domains (I, II, and III), each further split into two subdomains (A and B) that fold to create the typical heart-shaped conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The stability of the protein is ensured by 17 disulfide bridges created by 34 cysteine residues, one of which is a single free cysteine residue (Cys34) found in a hydrophobic crevice that is important for the antioxidant character of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The primary drug-binding sites are located in hydrophobic cavities within subdomains IIA and IIIA, designated Sudlow&#8217;s Site I and Site II, respectively. Sudlow Site I, positioned in subdomain IIA, preferentially binds bulky heterocyclic compounds such as warfarin, phenylbutazone, and azapropazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], whereas Sudlow Site II in subdomain IIIA has a high affinity for aromatic compounds such as ibuprofen, diazepam, and flufenamic acid. In addition to these primary binding sites, HSA possesses multiple secondary binding sites distributed across all three domains, including at least seven fatty acid binding sites, with sites 2, 4, and 5 exhibiting high affinity and sites 1, 3, 6, and 7 showing lower affinity. This extensive binding capacity, combined with HSA&#8217;s long circulatory half-life of 16&#8211;18&#160;h and conformational flexibility, enables the protein to serve as the principal transport vehicle for a remarkably wide range of endogenous compounds and pharmaceutical agents in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The multidomain structure and multifunctional properties of HAS, including drug binding, antioxidant activity, esterase activity, transport, and maintenance of oncotic pressure, are illustrated in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;2</label><caption><p>Structural and functional overview of HSA.

The inherent biocompatibility of albumin stems from its endogenous origin, absence of heterologous surface groups, and hydrophilic protein surface characteristics that preclude immune reactions and ensure excellent tolerance in biological systems. Clinical safety evidence spanning over eight decades demonstrates the exceptional safety profile of HSA, with the largest meta-analysis encompassing 26,351 patients across 58 clinical trials revealing no significant difference in mortality rates compared with alternative volume expanders. In critically ill patients, large-scale studies, including the SAFE trial with 6,997 participants and the Cochrane analysis of 10,842 patients, have consistently demonstrated the safety equivalence of albumin to crystalloid solutions, with no detectable signal of harm. The protein undergoes controlled enzymatic degradation through proteolytic pathways, which are primarily mediated by cellular proteases in lysosomes and secretory granules, resulting in the generation of bioactive peptides that may possess additional physiological functions. HSA has a remarkably long plasma half-life of approximately 19&#8211;21&#160;days in humans and is regulated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which protects the protein from intracellular degradation through pH-dependent binding and recycling mechanisms. However, enzymatic cleavage at the C-terminal leucine residue (L585) by carboxypeptidases can significantly reduce this half-life to 3.5&#160;days, although engineered albumin variants can be designed to maintain optimal FcRn binding despite potential C-terminal modifications. The biodegradability of albumin-based formulations has been confirmed through in vivo studies demonstrating controlled degradation rates of 23&#8211;53% over 28&#160;days, with degradation kinetics that can be modulated through formulation parameters. This combination of exceptional biocompatibility, predictable biodegradation, and extensive clinical safety validation positions human serum albumin as the gold standard carrier protein for pharmaceutical applications, with adverse events being exceptionally rare and primarily limited to mild reactions such as transient hypotension or localized inflammatory responses at therapeutic doses.</p><p id="Par49">Human serum albumin (HSA) has unique pharmacokinetic properties, primarily driven by its interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). After being taken up into acidic endosomal compartments, FcRn binds to albumin and rescues it from lysosomal degradation by recycling it back to the cell surface. This FcRn-mediated recycling process significantly extends the half-life of HSA in circulation to approximately three weeks, facilitating its stable presence in plasma and enabling prolonged delivery of albumin-bound drugs. The extended circulation time also augments passive tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, where the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumors allow albumin to preferentially extravasate and persist within tumor tissues.</p><p id="Par50">In addition to being passively accumulated, albumin displays natural tumor affinity via interactions with specific receptors, such as glycoprotein 60 (gp60), on vascular endothelial cells and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which is often overexpressed in tumor cells. Gp60 facilitates transcytosis of albumin across the endothelium, while SPARC binds and retains albumin within the tumor microenvironment, increasing the specificity of its cellular uptake and drug delivery. This receptor-mediated internalization ensures the selective delivery of albumin-bound therapeutics into cancer cells beyond what is afforded by the EPR effect alone. Together, these mechanisms underpin the capacity of albumin as a natural carrier that preferentially accumulates and releases therapeutics in tumors, improving its efficacy and minimizing systemic toxicity.</p><p id="Par51">These advantageous properties have been harnessed in FDA-approved drug formulations such as the nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which is used to treat metastatic breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Nab-paclitaxel exploits albumin&#8217;s solubilizing capacity and tumor-targeting mechanisms to enhance the delivery of paclitaxel, achieving higher tumor drug concentrations and improved therapeutic responses while reducing the solvent-related toxicity common to conventional formulations. In addition to nab-paclitaxel, many albumin-based formulations and nanoparticles are under development, leveraging the safety, biocompatibility, and inherent tumor-homing capabilities of albumin to create more effective and targeted cancer therapies. This convergence of pharmacokinetics, natural tumor affinity, and clinical application underscores the pivotal role of albumin in advancing drug delivery and oncology treatment paradigms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Strategies for albumin nanoparticle fabrication</title><p id="Par52">The&#160;desolvation method, often termed coacervation, forms the backbone of many albumin nanoparticle preparations; it involves the controlled dropwise addition of a desolvating agent (ethanol, acetone, or methanol) into an aqueous albumin solution under constant stirring until turbidity increases nanoparticle formation, followed by stabilization through chemical crosslinking with agents such as glutaraldehyde or carbodiimide (EDC) to harden inter- and intramolecular amino&#8210;to&#8210;amino bonds and prevent redissolution or aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In self-assembly approaches, albumin&#8210;drug conjugates exploit intrinsic hydrophobic domains: partial reduction of disulfide bonds (e.g., via dithiothreitol or glutathione) or conjugation to hydrophobic moieties exposes nonpolar pockets, enabling noncovalent loading of lipophilic drugs and spontaneous nanoparticle formation under mild heating or ionic strength conditions without crosslinkers, thereby preserving protein secondary structure while achieving high drug-loading efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The&#160;emulsification method&#160;encapsulates albumin within oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions: albumin is dispersed in the aqueous phase and emulsified with an immiscible organic solvent containing the drug, followed by solvent removal and nanoparticle solidification; this technique allows tunable particle sizes but often requires surfactants and extensive solvent removal to ensure biocompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Nab-technology (nanoparticle albumin-bound)&#160;refines emulsification by leveraging high-pressure homogenization of a paclitaxel-solvent phase into a presaturated albumin solution, yielding&#8201;~&#8201;130&#160;nm colloidal suspensions without crosslinkers; subsequent ultrafiltration removes residual solvents, producing reproducible, surfactant-free nanoparticles exemplified by FDA-approved nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) with&#8201;~&#8201;10% drug loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Comparatively, desolvation is highly&#160;scalable and reproducible&#160;with minimal equipment needs but relies on toxic crosslinkers; self-assembly offers&#160;biocompatibility and high drug loading&#160;but faces scale-up challenges; emulsification enables&#160;versatile drug encapsulation&#160;but demands rigorous solvent control; and nab technology combines&#160;clinical-grade reproducibility and stability&#160;with moderate drug loading, positioning it as the current gold standard for albumin nanoparticle fabrication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Once within the tumor microenvironment, impaired lymphatic drainage fails to clear these agents efficiently, leading to prolonged retention and sustained therapeutic concentrations of these agents compared with those in normal tissues. Nanoparticle accumulation via the EPR effect is highly dependent on physicochemical parameters: optimal size (10&#8211;100&#160;nm), neutral to slight negative surface charge, and hydrophilic coatings (e.g., polyethylene glycol) increase the circulation half-life and tumor uptake. Molecular mediators such as nitric oxide, bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and inflammatory cytokines further increase vascular permeability by loosening endothelial tight junctions and promoting transcytosis pathways. Pharmacological modulation strategies, including the administration of angiotensin II, nitroglycerin, and bradykinin analogs, have led to up to 3- to fourfold increases in EPR-mediated nanoparticle delivery in preclinical tumor models. Preclinical studies have reported that EPR-based delivery systems can achieve 10- to 20-fold higher intratumoral drug concentrations and improved antitumor efficacy than their free drug counterparts can achieve, highlighting the importance of passive targeting in nanomedicine design.</p><p id="Par54">However, inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in vascular density, permeability, and extracellular matrix composition leads to variable EPR efficacy across tumor types and individual patients, posing challenges for clinical translation. Tumors such as breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers often exhibit more pronounced EPR effects due to higher microvessel density and increased protease activity, degrading the extracellular matrix, whereas tumors with dense stroma, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, display limited nanoparticle penetration despite vascular leakiness. To visualize this phenomenon, the accompanying figure illustrates that PEG-coated magnetite nanoparticles and mitoxantrone start penetrating through the leaky tumor vasculature and accumulating within the tumor mass, underscoring the core principles of passive targeting via the EPR effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;3</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the passive targeting of PEG-coated magnetite nanoparticles and mitoxantrone in breast cancer via the EPR effect.

Albumin, a naturally abundant protein in the human body, possesses intrinsic properties that make it an excellent carrier for drug delivery, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to bind to various drugs and targeting ligands.

Albumin nanoparticles can be functionalized on their surface with specific ligands such as peptides (e.g., cRGDyK), antibodies, or small molecules that have high affinity for receptors overexpressed on TNBC cells or their microenvironment. These ligands guide the nanoparticles to bind specifically to receptors such as integrins (&#945;v&#946;3), SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), and other tumor-associated markers, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Such active targeting strengthens the accumulation of the albumin nanoplatforms in tumor tissue over the passive EPR-enhanced effect, increasing the drug concentration in the tumor while reducing systemic toxicity.

Multifunctional albumin-based nanoparticles are formed that deliver chemotherapeutic drugs, photosensitizers, or genetic material. By combining chemotherapy with targeted gene therapy and photodynamic therapy, synergistic activity can be achieved. These nanoplatforms demonstrate improved pharmacokinetics, better tumor specificity, and fewer side effects, showing promising potential to overcome the challenges associated with TNBC treatment by enhancing therapeutic efficacy via controlled and stimuli-responsive drug release mechanisms.

Importantly, the&#160;FDA has issued alerts&#160;regarding the specificity of the combination, noting that atezolizumab is approved only with nab-paclitaxel (not solvent-based paclitaxel) for PD-L1-positive mTNBC, as efficacy was not demonstrated with paclitaxel in the IMpassion131 trial&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">In addition to immunotherapy combinations, nab-paclitaxel has been studied with&#160;glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists&#160;such as mifepristone and relacorilant to overcome chemoresistance. A randomized phase II trial revealed that adding mifepristone to nab-paclitaxel did not improve PFS or ORR in advanced TNBC but was associated with increased grade 3 neutropenia (46% vs. 7%). In contrast, relacorilant (a selective GR modulator) combined with nab-paclitaxel improved PFS and duration of response in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, suggesting potential for further exploration in TNBC&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">Elderly patients&#160;with TNBC represent a vulnerable population that is often underrepresented in trials. The&#160;Ricciardi et al. study&#160;(2025) focused on patients&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;65&#160;years with HER2-negative mTNBC and reported that nab-paclitaxel monotherapy was effective and well tolerated, with a median PFS of 6&#160;months and a median OS of 40.5&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Similarly, the&#160;Schneeweiss et al. study&#160;(2025) confirmed the manageable safety profile of nab-paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer, with high-grade AEs occurring in&#8201;&lt;&#8201;8% of patients&#160;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].</p><p id="Par91">Ongoing challenges&#160;include identifying biomarkers for patient selection. While PD-L1 expression is currently used to guide immunotherapy combinations, the ANASTASE study revealed that most responders (97.6%) were PD-L1-negative, suggesting the need for broader biomarkers. Additionally, the&#160;Gioan et al. trial&#160;(2025) explored a triple combination of atezolizumab, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab in patients with TNBC and reported a median PFS of 11.0&#160;months and OS of 27.4&#160;months, regardless of PD-L1 status. These findings indicate that antiangiogenic agents may synergize with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, although this study used solvent-based paclitaxel, not nab-paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p><p id="Par92">When these data are integrated into practice, clinicians must balance the demonstrated PFS and subgroup OS advantages reported in IMpassion130 and corroborated them in subsequent real-world series, with a higher frequency of immune-related high-grade events observed across trials.

Taken together, these findings support the use of nab-paclitaxel as an effective chemotherapy backbone for PD-L1-directed immunotherapy in patients with metastatic TNBC and emphasize the importance of PD-L1 biomarker assessment, proactive management of immune-mediated toxicity, and continued investigation into optimal sequencing and combinations to maximize benefit with acceptable safety.<table-wrap id="Tab4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;4</label><caption><p>Summary of key clinical trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), including studies on study design, treatment regimens, efficacy outcomes, and safety profiles</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">ClinicalTrials.gov ID</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Phase</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Population</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Regimen</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Key efficacy outcomes</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Key safety outcomes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02425891">NCT02425891</ext-link> (IMpassion130)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">III</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Untreated metastatic/locally advanced TNBC</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Atezolizumab 840&#160;mg&#8201;+&#8201;nab-paclitaxel 100&#160;mg/m<sup>2</sup> vs placebo&#8201;+&#8201;nab-paclitaxel</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">PFS (ITT): 7.2 mo vs 5.5 mo;

however, their clinical translation is hampered by several critical challenges that must be addressed for improved therapeutic efficacy. One of the foremost concerns lies in drug loading and delivery efficiency, as the limited payload capacity of albumin nanoparticles often restricts the amount of therapeutic agent that can be carried, potentially necessitating higher or more frequent doses, thereby increasing the risk of systemic toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. This is highly related to the problem of release kinetics, as the controlled and site-specific release of drugs is central to optimizing therapeutic effects and reducing toxicity. In addition to delivery efficacy, the structural integrity of albumin nanocarriers under dynamic physiological conditions represents another considerable challenge. These include pH, ionic strength, and enzymatic variation, which can disrupt the integrity of the nanoparticle, induce aggregation or premature degradation, and emphasize the need for maximized surface modification to extend the circulation time. Concurrently, high tumor specificity continues to be elusive, with the reliance on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect being too often inadequate owing to interpatient heterogeneity in the tumor vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Whereas active targeting approaches, such as ligand or antibody functionalization, have been promising, the selection and display of these moieties are still delicate undertakings. In addition, whereas albumin is inherently biocompatible, chemical alterations can impart immunogenicity risks, thereby requiring extensive scrutiny of immune reactions and long-term safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. These difficulties increase the heterogeneity of TNBC itself. The heterogeneous molecular subtypes make the use of a one-size-fits-all albumin-based platform unviable, with subtype-specific nanocarrier designs necessitating deeper subtype-specific molecular knowledge. The physiological heterogeneity between patients, for example, variability in renal and hepatic functions and renal functions, impacts the metabolism and clearance of albumin-drug conjugates and affects bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Last, their translation from bench-scale innovation to universal clinical application on the basis of the creation of scale-up, affordable manufacturing techniques, as dependence on expensive materials might compromise availability or as intricate synthesis protocols. Cumulatively, these challenges are multifaced and highlight the need for a concerted strategy that integrates rational design, tumor biology knowledge, and sophisticated manufacturing to comprehensively unlock the therapeutic potential of albumin-based nanomedicines in TNBC. These challenges are overcome by considering TNBC&#8217;s very nature as a heterogeneous disease, with disparate molecular subtypes invalidating the notion of a one-size-fits-all albumin-based platform, which requires a subtype-specific nanocarrier design on the basis of a more profound molecular understanding. The physiological differences between patients, which include renal and hepatic functions, affect the elimination of albumin&#8210;drug conjugates and metabolism, thus affecting overall bioavailability.</p><p id="Par94">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> summarizes the key&#160;future directions and potential solutions&#160;for overcoming the challenges faced by albumin-based nanoplatforms in targeted drug delivery for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This review highlights essential strategies, including optimizing drug loading and release mechanisms, enhancing nanocarrier stability, improving targeting specificity, minimizing immunogenic reactions, developing personalized approaches to address TNBC heterogeneity, optimizing metabolism and clearance, and establishing scalable, cost-effective manufacturing processes.<fig id="Fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;5</label><caption><p>Key future directions for albumin-based nanoplatforms, illustrating solutions such as improving drug loading, stability, targeting specificity, personalization, metabolism, immunogenicity, and scalable manufacturing</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e1497" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="11671_2025_4411_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par95">The development of albumin-based nanoplatforms offers a transformative avenue for targeted therapy in TNBC, marked by significant advancements and ongoing challenges. Future directions emphasize personalized nanomedicine approaches tailored to address the molecular heterogeneity of TNBC, thereby enabling more precise and effective treatments. The design of multistimuli-responsive albumin nanocarriers that react to specific tumor microenvironment cues could enhance drug release control and therapeutic outcomes. The integration of albumin nanoplatforms with cutting-edge modalities such as gene editing and immunotherapy may increase anticancer efficacy through synergistic mechanisms. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial intelligence and multiomics data analysis in nanoplatform design will facilitate the rational optimization of these systems for individual patient profiles, supporting precision oncology and real-time treatment monitoring. In conclusion, albumin-based nanocarriers combine biocompatibility, functional versatility, and intrinsic tumor-targeting features to address key limitations in conventional TNBC therapy. These nanoplatforms improve drug delivery specificity, circumvent resistance mechanisms, and stabilize sensitive therapeutic agents. Nonetheless, challenges such as drug loading limitations, stability under physiological conditions, targeting specificity, immune interactions, and tumor heterogeneity remain critical barriers. Balancing these challenges with multifaceted opportunities requires integrated research efforts aimed at novel formulations, personalized strategies, and scalable production. Continued innovations in albumin nanomedicine hold substantial promise for advancing clinical translation and improving outcomes in TNBC patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALDH</term><def><p id="Par3">Aldehyde Dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATRA</term><def><p id="Par4">All-trans Retinoic Acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CARP-1</term><def><p id="Par5">Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Regulatory Protein 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDF</term><def><p id="Par6">3,4-Difluorobenzylidene Curcumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CD44</term><def><p id="Par7">Cluster of Differentiation 44</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSCs</term><def><p id="Par8">Cancer Stem Cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTLA-4</term><def><p id="Par9">Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCR</term><def><p id="Par10">Disease Control Rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOX</term><def><p id="Par11">Doxorubicin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECM</term><def><p id="Par12">Extracellular Matrix</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDC</term><def><p id="Par13">1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) Carbodiimide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGFR</term><def><p id="Par14">Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPR</term><def><p id="Par15">Enhanced Permeability and Retention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FNPs</term><def><p id="Par16">Functionalized Nanoparticles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FcRn</term><def><p id="Par17">Neonatal Fc Receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSH</term><def><p id="Par18">Glutathione</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p id="Par19">Hyaluronic Acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSA</term><def><p id="Par20">Human Serum Albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICB</term><def><p id="Par21">Immune Checkpoint Blockade</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC50</term><def><p id="Par22">Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIs</term><def><p id="Par23">Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IR</term><def><p id="Par24">Infrared</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kDa</term><def><p id="Par25">Kilodalton</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAR</term><def><p id="Par26">Luminal Androgen Receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAPK</term><def><p id="Par27">Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDR</term><def><p id="Par28">Multidrug Resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCF-7</term><def><p id="Par29">Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (breast cancer cell line)MDA-MB-231</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Mujibullah Sheikh, Deepak Khobragade, and Aashita Sakore contributed equally to the conceptualization, design, and execution of the experiments, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
