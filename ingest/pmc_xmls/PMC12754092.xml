<italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>) infection is widely considered to be a major risk factor for gastric cancer, contributing to its development through the Correa cascade.

<bold>Core Tip:</bold> This study revealed that Yin Yang 1 (YY1) was upregulated in <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic>-induced gastritis and gastric cancer, where it promoted tumor proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and growth by directly activating Janus kinase 2 transcription and enhancing Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation. YY1 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition reversed these malignant phenotypes. These findings elucidate a key mechanistic pathway in gastric carcinogenesis and identify YY1 as a potential therapeutic target for <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic>-associated malignancy.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Recent data from 2022 estimated around 968000 new cases and 660000 fatalities globally, highlighting the substantial health challenge that it represents[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although treatment options have advanced significantly in recent years, most patients are still diagnosed at advanced stages, leading to unfavorable outcomes. Thus, enhancing prevention and early detection remain a crucial focus in clinical management.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>), recognized as a group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization, triggers chronic gastric mucosal inflammation, impairs acid-secreting gland function, and initiates the Correa cascade&#8212;a stepwise progression from atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia and eventually gastric cancer[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Chronic <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection activates several signaling pathways, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor kappa B, Wnt, and Hippo, which contribute to the acquisition of stem-cell-like characteristics and facilitate gastric carcinogenesis[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite that <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection is present in most cases of gastric cancer, only 1%-3% of infected individuals develop malignancy, underscoring the importance of bacterial virulence determinants, host genetic variations, and environmental influences in determining clinical outcomes[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-associated malignant transformation is thus crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment.</p><p>Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a ubiquitously expressed zinc finger transcription factor involved in key biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its function is highly context dependent: YY1 can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor, influenced by the cellular physiological state and microenvironment[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. YY1 is overexpressed in several malignancies, including glioblastoma and esophageal, colorectal, prostate, breast, and liver cancers, where its upregulation is frequently associated with enhanced metastatic potential[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In gastric cancer, YY1 expression in tissues and cell lines is elevated, suggesting a role in proliferation, potentially mediated through the Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathway[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For instance, Geng <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated that YY1 contributes to apatinib resistance by suppressing ferroptosis. In contrast, Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] observed YY1 downregulation in gastric cancer and showed that its knockdown increased invasiveness and migration in MGC-803 and AGS cells. These contradictory reports indicate that the expression and functional role of YY1 in gastric cancer are not fully established, particularly in the context of <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-driven inflammation-to-cancer progression. To date, only one study has directly explored the relationship between YY1, <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> and gastric cancer[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, it did not delve into the mechanistic basis of <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-induced carcinogenesis <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> inflammatory progression. In the present study, transcriptomic analysis of gastric tumor tissues and matched nontumor samples, with or without <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection, along with coculture models of gastric cells exposed to <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>, consistently demonstrated significant upregulation of YY1 in gastric cancer, which was strongly associated with <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) refers to a biological process&#8212;occurring under physiological and pathological conditions&#8212;in which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal-like characteristics, either partially or completely[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Beyond its roles in embryogenesis and tissue repair, EMT is critically involved in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This transition is orchestrated by diverse signals from the tumor microenvironment, a heterogeneous ecosystem comprising immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipocytes within the extracellular matrix[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Across multiple cancer types, vascular endothelial growth factor has been shown to induce EMT through activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 pathway, promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor enhances EMT by metabolic reprogramming of lactate dehydrogenase A <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the JAK2/STAT3 axis[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In breast cancer, tumor-associated macrophages contribute to EMT and pulmonary metastasis through interleukin-6/STAT3/transglutaminase 2-mediated signaling[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that the transcription factor YY1 plays a critical role in <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-driven inflammation-to-cancer transformation and gastric carcinogenesis along the Correa cascade. <italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic> experiments established that YY1 promotes gastric tumor progression mainly by activating EMT-related gene expression, while its suppression markedly attenuates EMT-associated phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The normal gastric epithelial cell line GSE-1 and gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901, MGC803, AGS, HGC27, and MKN45 were obtained from GeneChem (Shanghai, China) and authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling in 2023.

First identified by Marshall and Warren in 1983, <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa and initiates the Correa cascade, a stepwise progression from chronic gastritis to gastric carcinoma, through virulence factors such as CagA, VacA, and urease[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, we identified YY1 as a transcription factor that is markedly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines, with high expression correlating with a poor patient prognosis. Importantly, we demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection induced YY1 expression along the Correa cascade, implicating YY1 in the inflammation-carcinogenesis axis.</p><p>YY1 is a multifunctional zinc finger transcription factor belonging to the Gli-Kr&#252;ppel family that acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our findings expand upon earlier reports that suggested a role for YY1 in tumor biology. While previous studies yielded inconsistent results regarding YY1 expression in gastric cancer, our clinical analyses, supported by GEPIA and starBase datasets, strongly indicate that YY1 is predominantly upregulated in tumors and portends unfavorable outcomes[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This suggests that YY1 serves as both a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target.</p><p>A major strength of our work lies in the integration of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, and clinical evidence. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> assays revealed that YY1 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, thereby conferring malignant phenotypes. These functional data were consistent with our xenograft model, in which YY1 overexpression significantly enhanced tumor growth, whereas pharmacological inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation suppressed this effect. These results establish YY1 as a driver of gastric tumor progression rather than a passive bystander.</p><p>We also showed that YY1 promotes EMT, as evidenced by decreased E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin, Snail, and vimentin expression. EMT is a fundamental biological process that contributes to tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis in various cancers, including gastric, breast, and lung carcinomas[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Among the key pathways involved, aberrant activation of the JAK/STAT signaling axis, especially through phosphorylation, is a well-recognized event in inflammation-driven oncogenesis[<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Chronic inflammation induced by <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection constitutes a critical enhancer of EMT progression and tumor development[<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>-<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests that YY1 modulates cancer progression and inflammatory signaling by regulating JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation[<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In our study, EMT induction was observed in gastric cancer cells and along the Correa cascade in patient tissues and <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-infected mouse models, supporting the clinical relevance of our observations. These findings add mechanistic insight into how YY1 may facilitate the sequential transformation of gastric epithelium during chronic infection.</p><p>Mechanistically, we identified the JAK2/STAT3 pathway as a critical mediator of YY1 function. Database prediction and ChIP assays confirmed direct YY1 binding to the JAK2 promoter, establishing transcriptional regulation. Functionally, YY1 silencing reduced JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation and reversed EMT, while pharmacological modulation of JAK2 confirmed that activation of this pathway is necessary and sufficient for YY1-mediated EMT. This is significant, as aberrant STAT3 activation is a hallmark of inflammation-driven oncogenesis, and our study directly links YY1 to this process.</p><p>Our data also highlight the role of <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection in modulating YY1 expression and EMT. In both cell culture and TFF1-KO mouse models, <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection markedly upregulated YY1, which correlated with increased mesenchymal markers and accelerated neoplastic transformation. These findings suggest that YY1 functions as a key molecular effector of <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-induced gastric tumorigenesis. Importantly, this provides a new mechanistic layer linking bacterial infection, chronic inflammation, and epithelial transformation through the YY1-JAK2/STAT3 axis.</p><p>This study had some limitations. The inflammatory milieu of chronic <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> infection is highly complex, involving cytokines such as interleukin-6 and bacterial virulence factors such as CagA, both of which are potent activators of STAT3[<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It remains possible that YY1 cooperates with or amplifies these signals rather than acting independently. Future studies using cytokine blockade or CagA-deficient bacterial strains will be needed to dissect the interplay between YY1 and other oncogenic stimuli[<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. While we demonstrated the oncogenic role of YY1 in xenograft models, patient-derived xenografts and organoid models would provide additional validation of clinical relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study demonstrates that YY1 is upregulated in gastric cancer and <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-associated gastritis, where it promotes proliferation, invasion, EMT, and tumor growth. Mechanistically, YY1 directly activates JAK2 transcription, thereby enhancing JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation and EMT progression. These findings clarify the role of YY1 in gastric cancer pathogenesis and highlight YY1 as a promising therapeutic target for <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic>-associated malignancies.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The results here are partially based upon data generated by the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.
