By February 2021, the mass had enlarged, accompanied by weight loss. Physical examination noted a large midline mass resembling a gravid uterus measuring 26 cm. Ultrasound showed a 17 cm cystic and solid right pelvic wall mass presumed to arise from the right adnexa, with an additional 8 cm mass within the right ovary. CBC, CMP, and chest x-ray were unremarkable aside from hypercalcemia, and CA-125 was elevated at 213 U/mL. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (AP) confirmed two large pelvic masses with no definite metastases (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure&#160;1</bold></xref>). Cytoreductive surgery was performed 2/5/2021, with significant endometriosis, adhesions, and bilateral ureteral scarring resulting in a modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Final pathology revealed FIGO Stage IIIB high-grade clear cell carcinoma with severe endometriosis, pT3b pN0, with positive bladder peritoneum and Morrison&#8217;s pouch involvement. Myriad genetic testing was negative, with no clinically significant germline mutations, and somatic profiling negative for BRCA1/2, GIS negative.

Clinical trials, including phase II trials with ipilimumab/nivolumab and lenvatinib/pembrolizumab at outside institutions were discussed. Interim imaging on 3/15/2023 showed hepatic mass progression to 13.5 cm, and she elected to undergo radiation while seeking lenvatinib/pembrolizumab trial enrollment. Given the tumor size, adjacent retroperitoneal nodes, and proximity to small bowel limiting dose, SFRT was pursued to optimize response while limiting toxicity. She received volumetric arc radiotherapy (VMAT) SFRT 20 Gy in 1 fraction forming 5 spheres within the right hepatic mass on 4/4/2023; planned per Grams et&#160;al. with 1.5 cm spheres placed within the gross tumor volume (GTV) with at least a 3 cm center-to-center separation and at least 1 cm from sphere edge to any organ at risk (OAR) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Authorization was granted following initial denial and appeal. Meanwhile, despite prior auto-approval, radiation coverage was denied post-treatment, cited as experimental, requiring a year of appeals and financial navigation. She started lenvatinib 20 mg daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3 weeks on 5/24/2023, with improvements in fatigue and abdominal pain. Imaging in August and November 2023 showed a reduction in the hepatic mass to 8.2cm with stable adenopathy. Calcium levels decreased and CA-125 stabilized at 16 U/mL. Following the new year her employer-sponsored health insurance switched companies. Although pembrolizumab was initially approved (February 2024), she received a denial letter again citing expiremental treatment, delaying treatment and requiring numerous appeals, letters, phone calls and even state congressional involvement to restore coverage.</p><p>Subsequent MRI Abdomen on 4/26/2024 showed hepatic lesion shrinkage (8.0 cm) with stable adenopathy aside from a slightly increased peri-aortic node and a chronic IVC thrombus. Reporting persistent abdominal pain and hypercalcemia, local therapy was reconsidered. Repeat CT CAP on 5/29/2024 confirmed MRI findings with no new disease (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure&#160;4</bold></xref>) and following multidisciplinary discussion, exploratory laparotomy with right hepatectomy, cholecystectomy, and radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy was performed 6/14/2024. Final pathology demonstrated a complete pathologic response with no viable tumor cells. At publication, she continues lenvatinib/pembrolizumab with intermittent holds for immunotherapy-related colitis, with stable CA-125 at 17 U/mL and recent CT 10/15/2025 showing no evidence of disease.

Reports of significant symptom relief, tumor regression, and disease control in historically radio-resistant histologies have been documented, including local bystander and distant abscopal effects (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Despite being cited as experimental for this patient, SFRT use dates back to 1909, utilizing physical blocks with holes in a &#8220;GRID&#8221; pattern to modulate dose and treat large superficial tumors (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). While not novel, modern technology and techniques such as VMAT have expanded applicability to deep-seated tumors or those abutting OARs. Enhanced understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and radiobiology have further renewed interest in SFRT. Intratumor hypoxia, present in bulky tumors, may increase hypoxia-inducible factors resulting in angiogenesis, cancer stem cell survival, immune evasion, and radiation resistance (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Dose-dependent responses to radiation may overcome these barriers and have shown immunomodulatory effects. In addition to direct cytotoxic effects, high-dose radiation may promote immunogenic cell death and enhance immune activation via cytokine and neo-antigen release and T-cell priming; upregulating PD-L1 and major histocompatibility class 1 expression, and activating the cGAS-STING pathway to promote immune cell maturation and polization (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Low-dose radiation may reshape the TME by polarizing macrophages to a M1 phenotype, increasing TNF-alpha and IL-12, and promoting normalization of tumor vasculature to improve oxygenation and immune infiltration (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the case of SFRT, combination high and low dose radiation may therefore synergistically augment anti-tumor response and microenvironment reprogramming, with postulation that intervening low dose regions may preserve perfusion for circulating factors involved in anti-tumor immunity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>As ICI efficacy relies on amplifying existing T-cell response, these radiation immunomodulatory effects may provide a synergistic approach to tumor control, and case reports utilizing SFRT with ICIs have shown promising results with partial and complete responses (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Additionally, re-sensitization following SFRT in pembrolizumab refractory patients has been reported (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). While this patient did not receive immunotherapy concurrently with SFRT, her complete pathologic response and greater than expected PFS may reflect the downstream impact of radiation, potentiating the anti-angiogenesis properties of lenvatinib and immunological response to pembrolizumab. Further investigation of this interaction is ongoing and could support future multimodal management and insurance coverage of SFRT.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Clinical trials, expanded access, and right to try</title><p>Drug development and new technology implementation are largely achieved through clinical trials. These trials offer hope and are pivotal in advancing cancer care, but remain plagued by long accrual times, inequitable access, and homogenous representation, raising concern about generalizability (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Patient-level barriers arise from logistics being away from home, travel costs, job concerns, and varying degrees of social support. Additional restrictions arise from provider lack of awareness and bias, study and institutional requirements, and resource availability (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). As this case demonstrated, local trial availability may be limited, forcing patients to travel to receive care; 38-52% of patients commute over an hour to participate on clinical trials - even longer in the Central United States (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Despite seeking out care and meeting initial enrollment criteria, patients may be disqualified due to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, historically included for statistical power, inadvertently result in generalizability uncertainty. The trial herein highlights these disparities, with exclusion criteria listing &#8220;those who&#8217;s social and economic status limit compliance with study requirements&#8221; &#8211; a stipulation not uncommon in trials (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>To address these issues the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) launched Project Equity, a health initiative aimed at addressing disparities in cancer trials, and multiple organizations have arisen to bolster patient engagement (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) additionally requires coverage of routine costs for patients on trials, but does not address indirect costs such as travel, lodging, and lost wages being away from work (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Certain Medicaid plans offer lodging assistance, and non-profit organizations such as the American Cancer Society and Ronald McDonald house provide short term housing options (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Additionally, local transit agencies, volunteers, and church groups may offer assistance. However, resources may not be universally available, and as our patient experienced, navigating them can be time-consuming. Early and robust social work involvement may help connect patients with the right resources&#8212; assuming availability.</p><p>For patients&#8217; ineligible for trials, the FDA Expanded Access (EA) pathway provides a route to pursue agents off trial. Known as &#8220;compassionate use&#8221;, patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses may utilize the EA pathway to gain access to investigational drugs, biologic, or medical devices when no comparable alternatives are available (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Assessed on a case-by-case basis, this pathway may be cumbersome and resource intensive, requiring coordination between the FDA, IRB, patient, physician, drug company, pharmacy, billing, and more. To assist, the FDA OCE launched Project Facilitate in 2019, a pilot to help providers request access to investigational therapies through the EA pathway (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The federal Right to Try Act (RTT) was passed in 2018, offering an alternate avenue from EA in obtaining access to investigational drugs, aiming to streamline the process by removing FDA approval and IRB oversight (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). RTT remains restrictive however, limited to terminally ill patients who have exhausted approved treatment options and are ineligible for trials. Investigational agents must have completed a phase I clinical trial and be under continued trial investigation for use or effectiveness (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>While both the EA and RTT pathways aim to improve patient access, a survey of community oncologists showed that despite awareness, only 46% had attempted to gain access to an investigational drug via EA, 14% via RTT (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Of those who utilized these pathways, success rates were high, with 89% obtaining access with EA, and 73% with RTT. While highlighting the success this program can have, poor utilization rates reflect the cumbersome processes and the administrative, clinical, and logistical challenges they pose. For patients who do gain access, companies developing the investigational product may only charge patients the direct product cost and shipping. They are not required to approve requests for access, and insurance companies likewise are not required to provide coverage (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This may render a potentially beneficial treatment unattainable due to financial barriers, despite technical approval, and may be devastating for patients without alternatives.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><title>Cancer as chronic illness and financial toxicity</title><p>Financial toxicity refers to the negative effect cancer treatments and their financial burdens have on patient quality of life, and is associated with early mortality and morbidity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). As treatments evolve, cancer is often a chronic condition marked by multiple lines of therapy. Chronic illness is the most expensive condition for employers, with rising costs increasingly shifted to patients through insurance premiums, copays, and deductibles (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Between 1999 and 2018, insurance premiums increased 239%, while wages only increased 68% (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Within one year of an early-stage cancer diagnosis, patients report losing one-third of their annual income (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Statistically, patients with cancer are 2.65 times more likely to file for bankruptcy, and 71% more likely to undergo foreclosure, repossession, or mortgage deliquency than those without cancer (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Resources exist to offset treatment costs during trials but are generally short-term and poorly equipped to support chronic cancer costs. Policy changes such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 have attempted to curtail rising costs and increase insurance accessibility and coverage. While this has had some benefit, out-of-pocket (OOP) costs have continued to rise. One analysis found nearly 40% of households lacked liquid resources to meet mid-range OOP limits, and 51% for high-range limits (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Drug therapies such as chemo- or immunotherapies are major cost drivers, and up to 45% of patients report medication nonadherence to cut costs (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Patients additionally cut basic needs such as food or clothing, skip doctor visits and tests, or forgoing mental health care (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). States have implemented copay caps and co-pay assistance programs to offset costs. Many have also called for drug transparency, and organizations like the American Medical Association have launched Truth in Rx, a campaign to promote price education and urge legislative action to address drug costs (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>Despite these efforts, financial toxicity solutions remain limited. Patients remain vulnerable to rising costs and reliant on insurance, public programs, and charity to access care. As treatment grows more complex and prolonged, patients turn to providers to navigate the system &#8211; yet fewer than 20% of patients talk about finances with their oncologist (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Crowdfunding has surged, with cancer accounting for 41.1% of all medical compaigns on GoFundMe (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Even with approval and support, such as this patient, ongoing treatment remains vulnerable to insurance, or policy changes beyond their control.</p><p>This patient&#8217;s experience reflects the challenges embedded in her local healthcare system. This does not exist in isolation. Multiple systematic reviews have unveiled the global burden of financial toxicity, with a recent review of 35 articles from 10 countries in 3 continents finding that more than half of all cancer patients experience catastrophic health expenditures (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The healthcare ecosystem is increasing complex, with multi-faceted costs. Global and regional solutions are urgently needed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This patient&#8217;s complete clinical and pathologic response to lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, and SFRT adds evidence to support these therapies in OCCC and underscores the promise of multimodal approaches. Further research on the immunomodulatory effects of radiation and SFRT is warranted, as well as the response durability of lenvatinib/pembrolizumab in OCCC. Additionally, her case exemplifies the challenges in accessing innovative treatments. Insurance denials, clinical trial ineligibility, and financial toxicity create significant barriers, forcing patients to navigate a fragmented and opaque system. As cancer shifts to a chronic disease, these issues become even more pressing and far-reaching. Addressing costs, coverage, and providing resource support could help ease this burden, while revisiting restrictive clinical trial eligibility criteria may make life-saving treatments more accessible and studied in &#8220;real-life&#8221; settings. The growing complexity of cancer care raises important questions about how to balance innovation and access, pushing not only the medical community, but the global healthcare ecosystem and society at-large to consider how new treatments are developed, reimbursed, and delivered to those who need them most.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Patient perspective</title><p>&#8220;I am 54 years old, and I would like to offer my perspective on my journey with my battle with Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma, and the obstacles I faced with my fight to live. Six months after losing my husband in 2020 to death, and my only child to a genetic mental illness, my journey to live began for me.</p><p>In Feb of 2021 I was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer, clear cell carcinoma. My treatment and my cancer is all documented in the article Mayo has written on my treatment success, and struggles,and that long road that got me here today, but my personal experiences, fighting the disease itself, as well as what I personally had to go through to be able to see this article written, and to be here to offer my perspective is not. First I want to say that I strongly feel that if I had received the lenvatinib and the pembrolizumab in the beginning of my disease, I quite possibly would not have had to endure the fight I had to go through, nor the severe disease progression that I experienced after chemotherapy, the 13 centimeter mass to my liver, and the hypercalcemia in my blood, and months of being very sick with a disease that does not respond to chemotherapy. I knew from doing my own research for months online, but my Doctor also knew the best medicine for me was available at a clinical trial in Boston Massachusetts, and I live in Wisconsin, when we first discussed this I was 85 pounds, and very sick, I lived all alone, and I didnt think I could do it, but then one morning I woke up crying. I said to myself you have no choice, Michelle, you have to go to Boston. So that morning I phoned Mayo Clinic and made an appointment with my Doctor. When I met with him, I said, I&#8217;m going to Boston. He was just as excited as me. I had to travel hundreds of miles from my home, I was 85 pounds and very sick, I had no one that could go with me, but I had no other choice, after all of this, I was excluded from that trial due to a pulmonary embolism. I was devastated to say the least, but my wonderful Doctor at Mayo Clinic fought for me to try the medicine off label, this man is, and will always be my hero. The medicine was a miracle for me. I was living to live again, my cancer was all shrinking, hypercalcemia had disappeared, and I gained 20 pounds from the 85 pounds I was when I attempted that clinical trial, but most importantly, I was making cherished memories with my Granddaughter, and the miracle for me was time. Then my employee sponsored insurance changed companies, they said I no longer could have the medicine, they claimed I was experimental investigational, even with all the ct scans that showed substantial shrinkage in my tumors, and all my clinical improvement, they denied even after an appeal, and even with me having congress involved in helping me fight for my medicine. I felt I had nowhere to turn, but I had to try, and I navigated to the top of my employer sponsored insurance, I had been at my job for 30 years, but I was on leave for a long time fighting my cancer, my employer overturned the denial for me, which was yet another miracle, I finally got to resume my medicine. I still have worries to this day that at any time this can be taken from me. It&#8217;s hard to think about, and It&#8217;s always in the back of your mind, but I know I wont ever give up. I started my journey in 2021, Chemotherapy does not work for my rare form of cancer, and yet it&#8217;s 2025, and this treatment is still not approved. I belong to several blogs with people that have my same disease, I see them suffer and pass away all the time, many of whom are younger than me. We have these medicinal miracles, and yet so few get access to them in time. I hope that my struggle, my miracles, and my story can help change the lives of others, and that they can get the medication I have, and have time to make the memories that I have been fortunate to be able to make. My team at Mayo Clinic, and the fight I have to never give up that has made it all possible for me.&#8221;</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="edited-by"><p>Edited by: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2902619" ext-link-type="uri">Robert Griffin</ext-link>, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, United States</p></fn><fn id="n2" fn-type="reviewed-by"><p>Reviewed by: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1132850" ext-link-type="uri">Tsz Him So</ext-link>, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/3181940" ext-link-type="uri">Lisa Bazzett-Matabele</ext-link>, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, United States</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
