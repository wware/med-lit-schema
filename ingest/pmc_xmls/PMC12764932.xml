A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis, signaling pathways and risk factors leading to PDAC is of paramount importance for identifying novel targets, prognostic markers, preventive strategies, and signature markers for use in specific and personalized therapeutic procedures. Activating somatic mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> oncogene play a critical role in PDAC initiation and maintenance. Here, we highlight the complex interplay between KRAS signaling, the transcriptional coactivator YES1-associated protein (YAP) and Src family kinases (SFKs) in the pathogenesis of PDAC and drug sensitivity. We subsequently focused on diet-induced obesity, which has been correlated with an increased risk for developing PDAC in humans and mice and more severe clinical outcomes. Accumulating evidence also indicates that neural signals regulate critical functions of cancer cells, including their proliferation and dissemination, and that chronic stress promotes PDAC through the sympathetic nervous system via &#946;-adrenergic receptors expressed by PDAC cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment. Obesogenic mediators and stress neurotransmitters stimulate protein kinases, including PKA and PKD, which converge on CREB/ATF1 phosphorylation in PDAC cells. Since stress and obesity cooperate to promote the progression of PDAC, novel combinatorial strategies to prevent this devastating disease could be developed, repositioning FDA-approved drugs that are extensively used to treat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders and diseases. Finally, we review new advances in the treatment of PDAC, focusing on the discovery of novel drugs that directly inhibit KRAS and YAP function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Gastrointestinal cancer</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01CA236585</award-id><award-id>R21CA258125</award-id><award-id>P01CA236585</award-id><award-id>R21CA258125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Rozengurt</surname><given-names>Enrique</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Eibl</surname><given-names>Guido</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI173050</award-id><award-id>R01AI135201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Rozengurt</surname><given-names>Enrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ronald S.

To date, surgical resection has remained the only curative therapy for PDAC, but 85% of tumors are diagnosed at an advanced stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and are therefore ineligible for surgery. Furthermore, in more than 80% of patients who undergo surgery, the resected tumors reappear within five years and, in some cases, as early as 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> The existence of micrometastases at the time of resection of the primary tumor drives subsequent recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Additionally, the survival benefit of current neoadjuvant (delivered before surgery) and adjuvant (given after surgery) chemotherapeutic regimens is moderate, and relapses often take place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Consequently, the 5-year survival rate remains at a dismal 13%.

In addition to Mst1/2, MAP4Ks function as alternative kinases that phosphorylate Lats1/2. In turn, Lats1/2 phosphorylates YAP at highly conserved residues (e.g., Ser-127 and Ser-397). The phosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 promotes its binding to 14.3.3 proteins, leading to its cytoplasmic retention, whereas its phosphorylation at Ser397 induces degradation. <bold>b</bold> When the Hippo pathway is inactive, YAP is rapidly dephosphorylated, it moves into the nucleus, where it activates TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1&#8211;4) and stimulates the expression of multiple genes. The upstream signals that activate YAP include G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, tyrosine kinase receptor (TRK) ligands and integrins. The activation of these receptors induces Rho activation (Rho-GTP), which promotes actin organization and striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) activation, a multiprotein complex that represses the Hippo pathway by preventing Mst1/2 activation. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase SRC regulates YAP localization via the phosphorylation and repression of LATS1/2, whereas YES1 directly phosphorylates YAP at Tyr357. SRC also phosphorylates and inhibits KRAS activity, thus eliciting opposite effects on the functions of YAP and KRAS. Notably, inhibitors that block both YES1 and SRC (e.g., dasatinib) prevent YAP nuclear accumulation but induce RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK activity by preventing KRAS tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition. The tyrosine phosphatase and scaffold SHP2 activates RAS/ERK, at least in part by dephosphorylating KRAS, but inhibits YAP function by antagonizing its Tyr357 phosphorylation.

A deep understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, signaling pathways and risk factors leading to PDAC is highly important for identifying novel targets, prognostic markers, preventive strategies, and signature markers for use in specific and individualized therapy. Active KRAS stimulates downstream signaling pathways that are essential for initiating PDAC but are not sufficient to promote the transition of preneoplastic PanIN lesions to overt PDAC. This process requires additional signaling inputs to drive pancreatic cell proliferation and PDAC promotion. Here, we highlight the complex interplay between KRAS signaling, the transcriptional coactivator YAP and SFKs in the development of PDAC, including the importance of these signaling proteins in metabolic reprogramming and in shaping the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="Par98">We also emphasize the importance of modifiable risk factors that function as tumor promoters of initiated pancreatic cells harboring <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations. In this context, diet-related metabolic disorders, including obesity, have been associated with increased risk and worse clinical outcomes for the development of PDAC in humans, and diet-induced obesity markedly accelerates the progression of low-grade PanINs to high-grade PanINs and PDAC in mice with mutated <italic toggle="yes">Kras</italic> in pancreatic cells. Accumulating evidence also indicates that neural signals regulate critical functions of cancer cells, including their proliferation and dissemination, and that chronic stress promotes PDAC through the sympathetic nervous system by acting via &#946;-adrenergic receptors expressed by PDAC cells and influencing other cells in the tumor microenvironment. We also emphasize that obesogenic mediators and stress neurotransmitters stimulate protein kinase signaling pathways, including PKA and PKD, which converge on CREB/ATF1 phosphorylation in pancreatic cancer cells. We envisage CREB as a key node in a signaling network engaged by stress and obesity that promotes the progression of <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>-initiated pancreatic cells.</p><p id="Par99">Since emerging results indicate cooperation between stress and obesity in promoting PDAC, it is plausible to envisage novel combinatorial strategies to prevent PDAC, repositioning FDA-approved drugs that are extensively used to treat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders as potential chemopreventive interventions. It will also be important to examine the cancer-preventive effectiveness of combinations of FDA-approved agents at low concentrations of each class, including &#946;-blockers, metformin, statins, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and consider replacing first-generation &#946; blockers with novel drugs (e.g., third-generation carvedilol). We also emphasize the identification of new molecules that directly target RAS proteins and YAP in PDAC as major areas of clinical research. Novel YAP/TEAD inhibitors provide a strategy to circumvent drug resistance caused by the release of negative feedback loops that fine-tune signaling downstream of RAS proteins. The development of novel approaches for the treatment and prevention of PDAC is a critical necessity that guarantees further mechanistic, preclinical, and clinical work.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Support for ER was from Grants P01CA236585, R21CA258125, R01AI173050, and R01AI135201.
