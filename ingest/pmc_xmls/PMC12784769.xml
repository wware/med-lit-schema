Clinical studies have suggested that increased cancer risk in type-2 diabetes may be attributed to unhealthy lifestyle factors and bad habits. Purpose: Patients with either <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> gene mutation or type-2 diabetes similarly exhibit increased cancer risk, insulin resistance, and fertility disorders. It was suggested that these three alterations derive from a common genomic failure, and its recognition may shed light on the unsolved secret of cancer.

(2) ER&#945;, BRCA1, and CYP19 aromatase proteins are transcription factors creating the crucial DNA stabilizer circuit driven by estrogen regulation. Liganded ER&#945; drives a second regulatory circuit to also control cell proliferation, in partnership with various growth factors. In a third regulatory circuit, liganded ER&#945; drives cellular glucose supply in close interplay with insulin, IGF-1, and glucose transporters. (3) Impaired expression or activation of each transcription factor of the triad leads to defective estrogen signaling and endangers regular cell proliferation, insulin sensitivity, and fertility. (4) Impaired estrogen signaling caused by either genetic or lifestyle factors alarms the hypothalamus, which issues neural and hormonal commands throughout the body to restore estrogen signaling. (5) When the compensatory actions cannot restore estrogen signaling, the breakdown of genomic regulation leads to cancer initiation. (6) Lifestyle factors that upregulate estrogen signaling decrease cancer risk, while downregulating estrogen signaling increases it. Conclusions: Increased cancer risk, insulin resistance, and infertility all originate from defective estrogen signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alcohol consumption</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>endocrine disruptor</kwd><kwd>estrogen</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>immune reaction</kwd><kwd>lifestyle factors</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>smoking</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-18-00078"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a major global challenge, attributed to its rapidly increasing morbidity and mortality rates worldwide [<xref rid="B1-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The exact mechanism of cancer initiation and progression remains unclear, and the results of extensive therapeutic efforts are fairly questionable.</p><p>According to the reigning opinion, cancer initiation derives from the incidence of oncogenic mutations that may either be inherited, increasing susceptibility, or acquired, arising under harmful environmental exposure [<xref rid="B2-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An accumulation of mutations in crucial genes presumably disrupt normal genomic regulation, leading to unrestrained cell proliferation. The majority of cancers may develop through unfortunate interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental influences [<xref rid="B3-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since only a small percentage of cancers exhibit solely inherited origin, small genetic differences among individuals may influence their response to environmental exposures, leading to increased or decreased risk for cancer.</p><p>Analysis of a large number of cancer genomes resulted in around 300 genes that were mutated in at least one type of cancer [<xref rid="B4-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The exact roles of presumably oncogenic mutations in cancer development have not been clarified. Increased prevalence of certain somatic mutations in the genes of various cancers does not necessarily confirm their oncogenic impact; instead, it may reflect a genome&#8217;s effort to repair [<xref rid="B5-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Historically, the first causal factor for cancer specifically affecting the female breast was introduced at the end of the 19th century. The clinically observed pulsation of tumors in parallel with the menstrual cycle mistakenly suggested that breast cancer growth may be associated with the ovulatory peak of serum estrogen levels. High concentrations of estrogen have emerged as a unique causal factor for premenopausal breast cancer. Surgical oophorectomy was applied as a causal therapy for breast cancer, targeting ovarian estrogen synthesis [<xref rid="B6-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the regression of breast tumors via surgical estrogen withdrawal was modest and transient [<xref rid="B7-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The therapeutic blockade of estrogen signaling has remained a gold standard for breast cancer care for centuries and continues to this day. However, the concept of estrogen-induced breast cancer led to further problems in cancer research and in the development of cancer therapy [<xref rid="B8-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In 1988, a causal factor for human diseases (and later for cancer) was introduced into the scientific world. Gerald Reaven established and popularized his concept in his Banting Lecture that a defect of insulin-assisted glucose uptake, known as insulin resistance, is the source of many human diseases [<xref rid="B9-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Insulin resistance was linked with a cluster of metabolic disorders, summarized as metabolic syndrome or syndrome X. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by impaired glucose metabolism, high blood pressure, central obesity, and low HDL-cholesterol coupled with increased triglyceride levels [<xref rid="B10-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In the early stage of insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia maintains the blood glucose levels within the physiological range by stimulating increased insulin secretion from pancreatic &#946;-cells [<xref rid="B11-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Advanced insulin resistance leads to metabolic syndrome, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [<xref rid="B12-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Type-2 diabetes develops when the compensatory insulin synthesis cannot keep up with the insulin demand of the insulin-resistant target cells, leading to hyperglycemia [<xref rid="B13-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thorough investigations have equivocally revealed that insulin resistance is the underlying disorder for developing cardiovascular diseases and cancers, which are the leading causes of human mortality [<xref rid="B14-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since insulin resistance leads to a significantly wide range of chronic human conditions, clarifying its origin appears to be crucial for identifying the principal regulator of the human genome.</p><p>Insulin-resistant status shows gender-related differences, as men exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic diseases compared to women. In addition, among women, premenopausal cases are protected from impaired glucose uptake via their active hormonal cycles, whilst postmenopausal cases exhibit an incidence rate of insulin resistance very similar to age-matched men [<xref rid="B16-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These gender- and menopause-related differences in the prevalence of insulin-resistant cases suggest that estrogen plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis and energy balance [<xref rid="B17-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, estrogen deficiency or impaired estrogen receptor activation appeared to be a causal factor for insulin resistance and the development of metabolic diseases [<xref rid="B18-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Gender-related differences are also evident in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="B20-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Healthy premenopausal women are typically protected from cardiovascular diseases and hypertension compared to age-matched men, suggesting protective effects of cycling estrogen levels [<xref rid="B21-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Estrogen plays a crucial regulatory role in the health of the cardiovascular system [<xref rid="B22-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After menopause, decreasing estrogen levels and the associated insulin resistance are important causal factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, myocardial dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and myocardial ischemia.</p><p>Pan-cancer analyses support that men, in general, show higher cancer incidence and worse survival than women across most cancer types [<xref rid="B23-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These sex-based differences in cancer incidence are likely due to a combination of biological, environmental, and behavioral factors; however, robust estrogen signaling in women seems to be protective against cancer. Oral cancer incidence shows obvious gender-related differences [<xref rid="B24-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Premenopausal women are highly protected from this tumor, while after menopause, estrogen loss is associated with a steeply increasing prevalence of the disease, even in nonsmoker, non-drinker cases. Breast cancer incidence is significantly higher in postmenopausal women as compared with premenopausal cases, showing increasing risk with age after menopause [<xref rid="B25-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In postmenopausal women, the loss of estrogen increases the risk for type-2 diabetes and obesity; these chronic conditions are strong risk factors for breast cancer.</p><p>The mechanism by which insulin resistance induces oncogenes remains highly debated. Investigators largely follow the traditional theory suggesting that increased concentrations of certain molecular players and somatic mutations of their genes are causal factors for cancer initiation and progression. Over the past decades, hyperinsulinemia [<xref rid="B15-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], hyperglycemia [<xref rid="B26-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B27-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and increased growth factor signaling [<xref rid="B28-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have been proposed as cancer initiators in insulin-resistant cases. Although the presence of these alterations is characteristic of insulin resistance, they may be regarded as compensatory efforts for restoring genomic functions rather than facilitating cancer development [<xref rid="B8-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This work introduces defective estrogen signaling as a causal factor in cancer initiation and progression, highlighting the noteworthy genome-repairing efforts of healthy cells, tumor cells, and the whole human body.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-cancers-18-00078"><title>2. Theories Suggesting Various Initiators of Insulin Resistance</title><p>There has been continuous debate on the origin of insulin resistance and the cause&#8211;effect relationship between insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (<xref rid="cancers-18-00078-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It has been equivocally established that their coexistence leads to serious chronic conditions and increasing mortality [<xref rid="B29-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Until the beginning of the 21st century, insulin resistance itself was regarded as the origin of disorders leading to metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes, while the associated excessive insulin synthesis seemed to be a compensatory action helping cellular glucose uptake [<xref rid="B30-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The origin of insulin resistance appears to be variable, and the relative importance of each presumed causal factor has been thoroughly investigated [<xref rid="B31-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In searching for the causal factors of insulin resistance, authors have focused on the roles of various pathological findings that are associated with impaired glucose uptake.</p><p>Low-grade inflammation is regarded as a causal factor of insulin resistance. It can disrupt insulin signaling pathways, leading to a reduced ability of cells to respond to insulin and to take up glucose from the blood [<xref rid="B32-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Alterations in lipid metabolism, such as increased free fatty acids and the accumulation of lipid intermediates, cause insulin resistance by interfering with insulin signaling pathways. This lipotoxicity can impair cellular glucose uptake and leads to lipid deposition in tissues such as muscle and liver [<xref rid="B33-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The gut microbiome influences insulin sensitivity by producing metabolites that can affect insulin sensitivity, energy metabolism, and inflammation. Lower microbial diversity and the presence of certain bacteria-producing inflammatory molecules are linked to insulin resistance. Conversely, higher diversity and the presence of specific bacteria, such as <italic toggle="yes">Coprococcus</italic>, may improve insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="B34-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the development of insulin resistance, both mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated. Experimental studies on insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes from mice provided evidence that mitochondrial oxidative stress is the origin of insulin resistance, while oxidative phosphorylation remained unaffected [<xref rid="B35-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The insulin resistance of muscle and adipose tissue appeared to originate from impaired intracellular GLUT4 transport [<xref rid="B36-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which could contribute to the development of metabolic changes and insulin resistance syndrome.</p><p>Recent studies have established that hyperinsulinemia equivocally precedes insulin resistance, becoming a causal factor in defective glucose uptake, obesity, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer [<xref rid="B37-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) cases, hyperinsulinemia appears to be the predecessor of insulin resistance, creating a self-generating cycle that worsens reproductive and metabolic defects [<xref rid="B43-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, the initiator of either insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia remains unclear.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that genetic background, together with over-nutrition, may induce hyperinsulinemia, which appears to precede insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia is regarded as a major driver of obesity, type-2 diabetes, and their associated chronic conditions [<xref rid="B44-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Presumably, energy-rich food intake drives increased insulin synthesis by pancreatic &#946;-cells. Over time, these &#946;-cells become exhausted, and their insulin production cannot keep up with the insulin demand of resistant cells, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels and type-2 diabetes. It has also been proposed that hyperinsulinemia dysregulates the balance of the insulin-GH-IGF axis, promoting lipid deposition.</p><p>The development of type-2 diabetes via hyperinsulinemia is explained by a proposed interplay among insulin, GH, and IGF-I [<xref rid="B40-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Type-2 diabetes develops as increased insulin levels in the portal vein increase the liver&#8217;s sensitivity to growth hormone (GH). The liver then increases insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production, which leads to negative feedback on the hypothalamus, significantly decreasing GH levels. The resulting low GH/insulin ratio stimulates lipogenesis and increases body weight.</p><p>In clinical practice, diabetes treatment using insulin with high affinity for IGF-I receptors improves the lipid profile, increases insulin sensitivity, and enhances glucose metabolism [<xref rid="B41-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. IGF-I showed cardio-protective effects and improved insulin sensitivity in patients following a myocardial infarction [<xref rid="B42-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These results suggest that insulin-stimulated IGF-I signaling improves endocrine regulation and metabolic balance instead of disrupting them.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-cancers-18-00078"><title>3. The Origin of Insulin Resistance Is a Defect in Estrogen Signaling, While Hyperinsulinemia Is a Compensatory Effort to Improve Estrogen Regulation</title><p>Since glucose is essential for cellular health and fuels all cellular functions, glucose deprivation significantly affects the continuous operation of the main regulatory circuits of ER alpha. These circuits control genome stabilization, cell growth/proliferation, and glucose supply [<xref rid="B46-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Insulin and IGF-I are important players in the regulatory circuits of ERs, controlling glucose supply and metabolic balance. Impaired ER expression/activation or low estrogen levels upregulate compensatory insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia as an attempt to restore estrogen signaling, even if this effort is not successful.</p><p>Impaired estrogen signaling creates an emergency situation for mammalian cells by disrupting glucose and lipid metabolism while simultaneously endangering genomic stability (<xref rid="cancers-18-00078-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The hypothalamus&#8211;hypophysis unit then sends neuro-endocrine signals to adipose tissue, directing the upregulation of estrogen synthesis and ER activation. Restoration of estrogen signaling improves glucose uptake, metabolic homeostasis, and energy expenditure in insulin-resistant patients [<xref rid="B47-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Insulin and estrogen (specifically 17&#946;-estradiol) signaling work together to activate glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) by promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B49-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Incorporation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane allows the entrance of glucose into the cell. In estrogen deficiency, increased insulin levels may exert a complementary effect on GLUT4 translocation, facilitating cellular glucose uptake.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has a direct role on glucose uptake, working in partnership with insulin, particularly in peripheral sites, such as adipose tissue and muscles [<xref rid="B50-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. IGF-I promotes glucose uptake by activating its own IGF-I receptors and hybrid receptors that react to both IGF-I and insulin receptors (IRs). Amplified insulin levels facilitate IGF-I signaling. Then, IGF-I activation increases the unliganded activation of membrane-associated ERs, closing the regulatory circuit [<xref rid="B51-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Low-grade inflammation is a characteristic finding in insulin-resistant adipose tissue. Insulin and IGF-1 signaling have complex regulatory effects on the development of inflammation. In healthy adipose tissue, they act as anti-inflammatory agents. Conversely, in insulin resistance, including obesity and aging, increased insulin and IGF-1 signaling together promote inflammation [<xref rid="B52-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In insulin resistance, macrophages and immune competent cells are recruited to increase pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, facilitating aromatase enzyme activity and estrogen synthesis [<xref rid="B53-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. When the estrogen concentration reaches an adequate level, estrogen signaling improves cellular glucose uptake. Restored glucose uptake then reduces inflammation and lowers the estrogen concentration [<xref rid="B8-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, low-grade inflammation remains, as estrogen levels cannot reach a suitably high concentration to improve glucose uptake.</p><p>Estrogen and insulin exhibit close interplay in regulating the balance between lipolysis and lipogenesis. In insulin resistance, impaired estrogen signaling liberates free fatty acids (FFAs), while hyperinsulinemia cannot exert its powerful anti-lipolysis effect [<xref rid="B54-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In obesity, abundant FFAs in the circulation are pathologically deposited in non-adipose organs and tissues, such as the liver, pancreas, skeletal muscles, and the heart [<xref rid="B55-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>In postmenopausal women, estrogen deficiency decreases the body&#8217;s ability to oxidize (burn) lipids, leading to insulin resistance and fat accumulation. In obesity, weak estrogen signaling in the background leads to dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and visceral lipid deposition [<xref rid="B56-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) is an enzymatic hydrolyser of cAMP and cGMP pathways in cooperation with estrogen. They co-regulate the key metabolic actions of estrogen: lipolysis, energy homeostasis, and insulin secretion. Pharmacological blockade of AKT phosphorylation and PDE3B expression promoted lipolysis even in the presence of insulin [<xref rid="B59-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These findings support that, in insulin resistance, estrogen deficiency-induced damage to AKT and PDE3B pathways inhibits the anti-lipolysis action of insulin, despite its high concentrations.</p><p>Takeuchi et al. published in Nature that in humans, increased carbohydrate metabolism by the gut microbiota contributes to the development of insulin resistance [<xref rid="B60-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In insulin-resistant patients, increased fecal carbohydrate content, associated with microbial metabolism, showed strong correlations with inflammatory cytokines. Recently, it was established that gut bacteria associated with insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance exhibited different patterns of carbohydrate metabolism [<xref rid="B61-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Additionally, bacteria associated with insulin sensitivity improved insulin resistance in a mouse model.</p><p>Unique bacterial components of the gut microbiome, known as the estrobolome, play a crucial role in the reactivation of inactive, bound estrogens, supporting insulin synthesis in pancreatic &#946;-cells [<xref rid="B57-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Inactive, conjugated estrogens delivered from the liver via bile secretion may be reactivated in the gut by estrobolome bacteria showing high &#946;-glucuronidase activity. In conclusion, the accumulation of gut bacteria with high &#946;-glucuronidase activity improves insulin sensitivity by increasing the levels of bioactive estrogens. In postmenopausal women, a partnership was observed between estrogen deficiency and dysbiosis of gut bacteria, leading to the development of type-2 diabetes [<xref rid="B62-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Recently, gut bacterial sequences were found in healthy brain samples, suggesting that there is a microbiome in the brain [<xref rid="B63-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Considering the importance of high &#946;-glucuronidase activity in the gut, it can be presumed that intestinal bacteria also reactivate conjugated estrogens in the brain, increasing the levels of bioactive estrogen.</p><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of insulin resistance. Dysfunction of mitochondria leads to decreased &#946;-oxidation, low ATP creation, and increased ROS production [<xref rid="B64-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Estrogen maintains mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial quality control [<xref rid="B65-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Insulin and estrogen signaling converge on Sirt1, mTOR, and PI3K signaling pathways to jointly regulate autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism [<xref rid="B58-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia serves as an effort to compensate for the lack of estrogen regulation on mitochondria.</p><p>In conclusion, estrogen signaling as the chief regulator of metabolic processes shows strong interplay with insulin, IGF-I, and other molecular players participating in the control of glucose uptake. The defect of estrogen signaling impairs glucose uptake while recruiting insulin and IGF-1 to restore the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. In crisis situations, growth factor receptors, including the IGF-1 receptor, are capable of the unliganded activation of ERs.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-cancers-18-00078"><title>4.

The hypothalamus regulates hormone production of hypophysis and sends neural impulses through the autonomic nervous system. In the hypothalamus, estrogen is the primary coordinator between the circadian system and gene expression/activation, adapting all mental, somatic, and reproductive functions to changes in light and darkness in mammals [<xref rid="B206-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>].</p><p>Estrogen is the main regulator of bio-energetic systems in the brain and the body via hypothalamic activation [<xref rid="B207-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>].

Females exhibit gender-specific protection against metabolic diseases, while males exhibit increased disease susceptibility. Adipose tissue regulation is driven by the activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) through neuro-hormonal interactions with other hormones, particularly insulin and adipokines [<xref rid="B147-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>].</p><p>Hormonal and neural signals from all regions of adipose tissue reach the hypothalamus, conveying information about their own energy homeostasis and those of various adjacent organs and tissues [<xref rid="B212-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>].

Epidemiological evidence links major risk factors, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy dietary patterns, and physical inactivity, to cancer incidence and mortality.</p><p>Smoking is the main cause of cancer among harmful lifestyle factors and affects several regions, such as the oral cavity, digestive tract, upper respiratory tract, lung, urinary tract, cervix uteri, and ovaries [<xref rid="B216-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>].</p><p>Smoking is linked to insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="B217-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. It increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via dysregulation of the hormones participating in glucose uptake and causing a shift in lipogenesis and lipid deposition, which promotes abdominal obesity [<xref rid="B218-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>].

Excessive alcohol consumption is an independent risk factor for type-2 diabetes [<xref rid="B222-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Drinking alcohol is closely correlated with cancer development in the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus [squamous cell carcinoma only], colorectum, liver [hepatocellular carcinoma only], and female breast [<xref rid="B216-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>].</p><p>Multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to cancer development mediated by drinking [<xref rid="B223-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Acetaldehyde, deriving from ethanol metabolism, is a potent carcinogen capable of inducing DNA damage and mutations. During alcohol metabolism, oxidative stress can damage cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to genetic mutations and genomic instability [<xref rid="B224-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>].</p><p>Alcohol abuse disrupts the hypothalamic regulation of the endocrine system, affecting various hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, stress, and reproduction, leading to metabolic disorders, cognitive decline, and infertility [<xref rid="B225-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. Alcohol upregulates aromatase activity and increases estrogen levels in women who drink heavily, which are presumably the causal factors for their increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers [<xref rid="B226-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. In reality, the increased aromatase activity and estrogen synthesis in drinkers are compensatory responses to the inhibition of ERs and developing insulin resistance.</p><p>The toxic effects of ethanol were studied on osteoblasts in female rats and on cultured osteoblasts in vitro [<xref rid="B227-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. Ethanol inhibited estrogen receptor signaling by blocking both ER alpha and ER beta activation, while estradiol treatment restored the health of osteoblasts. These results explain that bone loss develops in highly alcohol-exposed females, while estrogen treatment exhibits protective effects.</p><p>Alcohol-induced blockade of ER activation dysregulates all genomic functions and increases the risk for several cancers in both men and women, despite the increased compensatory estrogen concentration. The aromatase inhibition from smoking and the ER blockade from drinking clearly explain the amplification of cancer risk in patients who have both smoking and drinking habits.</p><p>Unhealthy dietary patterns have great role in the development of obesity and increased cancer risk. Overeating and excess body weights are associated with increased risk for cancer in the esophagus (adenocarcinoma only), gastric cardia, colorectum, liver, pancreas, endometrium, ovary, kidney, thyroid, and female breast (postmenopausal cancers only) [<xref rid="B228-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. Interestingly, among premenopausal women, consistent inverse associations have been observed between obesity and breast cancer risk [<xref rid="B229-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. Overeating in premenopausal women with healthy hormonal balance leads to gluteofemoral adiposity, which is independent of metabolic disorders. It is not obesity but rather cycling estrogen levels and the insulin sensitivity of abdominal adipocytes that protects obese young women from metabolic diseases and breast cancer [<xref rid="B230-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>].</p><p>Diet quality is a significant factor in the development of insulin resistance.

Diet and nutrition appear to be modifiable risk factors for the development of several cancers, but their associations may be faulty due to the inherent bias of investigations [<xref rid="B232-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Only a few single foods or nutrients appeared to be strongly or suggestively associated with cancer risk, as tumor development is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors beyond diet quality.</p><p>Sedentary lifestyle has wide-ranging adverse impacts on the human body, including high risks of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, musculoskeletal disorders such as sarcopenia and osteoporosis, as well as depression and cognitive impairment [<xref rid="B233-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>Tumorigenesis is a multistep process, initiating with oncogenic mutations in a normal cell. The next steps are the pervasive somatic mutations conferring clonal advantage in the neighborhood. Pervasive somatic mutations and clonal expansion in tumor-free tissues rarely lead to transformation into cancer [<xref rid="B236-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. Recently, researchers have suggested that environmental cancer risk factors may highly influence the early clonal expansion and malignant transformation of mutated cells [<xref rid="B237-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>].</p><p>Recent research strongly suggests that environmental and lifestyle factors are the primary drivers of cancer. About 93% of all cancers are nonhereditary, highlighting the significance of environmental and lifestyle factors in carcinogenesis.

Mutation-associated alteration in BRCA1 protein inhibits the liganded activation of ERs, while a compensatory increased unliganded ER activation was proven in the affected cells [<xref rid="B76-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The genetically defined ER resistance is a stress at the cellular level inspiring both local and hypothalamic counteractions for the improvement of estrogen signaling and genomic stability. Cells with germline <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations increase their estrogen synthesis [<xref rid="B86-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and activate the gene of p53 protein via somatic mutation [<xref rid="B90-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The hypothalamus improves estrogen synthesis in the gonads, and stimulates growth factor secretion via the GH-IGF-1 axis, promoting the unliganded activation of ERs in the regulatory circuits of cell proliferation and glucose uptake [<xref rid="B141-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>].</p><p>Among <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> gene mutation carriers, breast and ovarian cancer risk is highly increased in spite of all compensatory mechanisms as these organs show extreme necessity for estrogen-controlled regulation.

They fight against genomic instability via protective somatic mutations and they can achieve a delay of cancer development, or in the minority of cases, cancer does not develop. Germline oncogenic mutations are controversial to the theory of multistep carcinogenesis. Oncogenic mutation in a single cell may be a frequent event in the human body. However, the intelligent cell can fight against its genomic instability instead of generating invasive colonies with oncogenic mutations.</p><p>Studies on insulin resistance, including type-1 and type-2 diabetes, provided great possibilities for cancer research as insulin resistance and its comorbidities are strongly associated with increased cancer risk. These two types of diabetes apparently seem to be highly different in their origin, while their progression and the developing co-morbidities show quite similar features.</p><p>Defect of estrogen signaling seems to be a common origin of both types of diabetes as estrogen-regulated genes control the metabolic and hormonal equilibrium as well as immune cell development and function [<xref rid="B141-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Either in type-1 or type-2 diabetes, a characteristic triad of impaired estrogen signaling may be experienced: fertility disorder, insulin resistance and increased cancer risk.</p><p>The origin of insulin resistance may be associated with genetically defined familiar inclination. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases lifestyle factors seem to be linked with developing metabolic and hormonal disorders. The vast majority of genetic loci associated with type-2 diabetes development are primarily linked with pancreatic &#946;-cell development and function as well as insulin secretion [<xref rid="B240-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. Genes associated with cellular glucose transport are rarely affected. In type-2 diabetes cases, the circuit of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CYP19</italic> genes does not show mutation and the upregulation of estrogen signaling may easily compensate the difficulties of glucose uptake circuit. Since the development of type-2 diabetes is associated with ageing and menopause in women, the genetic inclination may be manifested in correlation with weakening compensatory efforts. In cases without genetic alterations, lifestyle factors and bad habits may promote the development of insulin resistance. Overeating, excessive sugar consumption, lack of physical activity, smoking and alcohol drinking downregulate the main genomic circuit and insulin resistance develops.</p><p>Insulin resistance has an insidious onset and through hyperinsulinemia and metabolic syndrome type-2 diabetes develops. In hyperinsulinemia, the increased insulin secretion of pancreatic &#946;-cells can recruit further partners for the facilitation of glucose uptake and the maintenance of normal glucose level. In metabolic syndrome, several molecular changes can be observed that worsen the metabolic and hormonal disorders, while others have improving efforts for the facilitation of aromatase expression and ER reactivation. Increased insulin and IGF-1 signaling stimulate inflammatory reactions in insulin-resistant adipose tissue [<xref rid="B51-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines stimulates aromatase expression and increases estrogen concentration [<xref rid="B52-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Increased estrogen concentration restores glucose uptake and a decreasing estrogen level silences the inflammation [<xref rid="B8-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Increased expression of IGF-1 alone has a direct role in glucose uptake via unliganded ER activation [<xref rid="B50-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Insulin and estrogen signaling together facilitate intracellular glucose transport [<xref rid="B49-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In conclusion, the origin of insulin resistance is a downregulation of estrogen-controlled genes.

In patients with type-1 diabetes, additional autoimmune diseases may develop, most frequently Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroiditis in 17&#8211;30% of cases [<xref rid="B242-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>].</p><p>The role of estrogens in the development of autoimmune processes seems to be controversial.

Considering that estrogens are the chief regulators of immune responses [<xref rid="B179-cancers-18-00078" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>], autoimmunity is a failure of the immune system attributed to impaired estrogen signaling.

Conclusions</title><p>Reduced estrogen signaling caused by either endogenous or environmental factors is alarming for the hypothalamus, which sends neural and hormonal signals throughout the whole body to restore genomic stability.</p><p>In the first, compensated phase of defective estrogen signaling, patients appear healthy. Hyperinsulinemia is a subtle signal of the genome indicating successful restoration of estrogen signaling, but it occurs at the expense of excessive insulin synthesis. Over time, impaired estrogen signaling and glucose uptake result in metabolic syndrome, characterized by various symptoms and altered laboratory findings. Compensatory molecular changes are warnings that the genome is struggling to restore estrogen signaling and DNA stability. Increasingly impaired estrogen signaling leads to type-2 diabetes, showing increased serum glucose levels despite all compensatory actions. Simultaneously, organs suffer from the lack of glucose and excessive lipid deposition. The complete breakdown of estrogen signaling results in DNA damage and cancer initiation in the affected organ. Cancer development is the genome&#8217;s cry for help to combat against dysregulation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

Hypophysis increases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), stimulating the gonads to produce sex steroids. Increased growth hormone (GH) secretion facilitates IGF-1 production in different organs, improving hormonal regulation. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the adrenal gland to produce sex steroids and cortisol. The heart experiences lipid deposition, decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, and dysregulation of clotting factors. The liver shows compensatory increased IGF-1 synthesis, decreased vitamin D synthesis, and increased lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and coagulation factor synthesis, further disrupting genomic regulation. Pancreatic &#946;-cells exhibit compensatory increased insulin synthesis. The gut loses the bacteria of the estrobolome that are crucial for the reactivation of bound estrogens and allow the recirculation of free estrogens. Fat adipocytes show decreased estrogen receptor (ER) and aromatase expression, but increased compensatory IGF-1 synthesis. Increased lipolysis leads to high free fatty acid (FFA) levels and lipid deposition, even in non-adipose tissues. Stromal adipose cells are capable of increased aromatase synthesis. Mitochondria show functional disorders, leading to decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, while an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) shows their oxidative stress. Low-grade inflammation (LGI), comprising monocytes and lymphocytes represents an immune reaction. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF&#945;) increase aromatase expression and estrogen concentration. The thyroid gland shows lower thyroxine synthesis, worsening genomic functions. Adrenal gland stress increases cortisol synthesis, further worsening glucose tolerance. Androgen level increases are attributed to aromatase deficiency. Skeletal muscle shows compensatory increased IGF-1 signaling, while decreased aromatase and estrogen synthesis increase lipid deposition. Gonads are stimulated for increased androgen synthesis, while the lack of aromatase activity leads to estrogen deficiency. N: nucleus. Red arrows: worsening insulin resistance. Green arrows: efforts for improving estrogen signaling.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="cancers-18-00078-g001.jpg"/></fig><fig position="float" id="cancers-18-00078-f002" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Skeletal muscle cell in contraction.
