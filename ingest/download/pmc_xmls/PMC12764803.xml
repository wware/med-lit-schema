In 2022, more than 420,000 new cases and nearly 98,000 deaths were reported worldwide, with China accounting for the highest number of new diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Over the past two decades, research on EC has undergone a significant shift, evolving from a primary focus on early detection to addressing the more urgent task of identifying high-risk patients with aggressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The molecular classification proposed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has demonstrated considerable prognostic value and has been clinically implemented through frameworks such as TransPORTEC and ProMisE, enhancing the feasibility of molecular subtyping in routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite the lack of standardised testing protocols and challenges related to implementation costs, molecular biomarkers have significantly advanced risk assessment, therapeutic decision-making, recurrence prediction, and target discovery. In 2023, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) incorporated TCGA subtypes into its staging system, integrating molecular features with conventional staging to improve the precision of risk stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nonetheless, accurately forecasting patient outcomes and optimising adjuvant therapy selection remain among the most pressing challenges in EC management. Current TCGA-based molecular subtyping, although impactful, has inherent limitations: it does not assess the functional integrity of DNA repair pathways such as homologous recombination, lacks sensitivity to genome-wide chromosomal instability, and fails to account for intragroup heterogeneity&#8212;particularly within the MSI-H and TP53-wild-type subtypes. Furthermore, TCGA subtyping provides limited predictive insight into therapeutic response, especially in the context of DNA repair competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These gaps underscore the need for a more integrative genomic profiling approach&#8212;one that not only captures established molecular subtypes but also delivers deeper DNA-level insights. Such a strategy could facilitate more nuanced patient stratification, elucidate subtype-specific biological variation, improve prognostic accuracy, and inform precision treatment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a critical mechanism of genomic instability arising from defects in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, which plays a central role in the maintenance of DNA integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Loss of HRR function results in the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, chromosomal aberrations, and large-scale structural alterations that contribute to tumour progression and impact response to DNA-damaging agents such as platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. HRD may also contribute to elevated tumour mutational burden and immune microenvironment variability, which have implications for therapeutic vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In EC, HRD is increasingly recognised as a biologically distinct and clinically relevant phenomenon. EC tumours with HRD features tend to display extensive chromosomal instability and are more likely to harbour mutations in DNA damage response genes such as TP53 and ARID1A, even in the absence of BRCA1/2 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These observations suggest that HRD in EC represents a convergent phenotype of genomic stress rather than a mutation-restricted event. Importantly, HRD-high represents a functional deficiency in HRR, distinct from TP53 mutations or generalised copy-number gains, which may reflect alternative pathways of genomic instability rather than specific DNA repair defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given these biological attributes, HRD serves as a promising complementary biomarker to existing classification frameworks. Unlike TCGA subtyping, which is primarily mutation- or pathway-based, HRD scoring quantifies structural consequences of impaired DNA repair across the genome. This functional perspective may enable improved resolution of molecular heterogeneity within TCGA categories and provide additional insight into therapeutic sensitivity.</p><p id="Par8">Currently, several methods are available for assessing HRD status. These include: (1) identification of deleterious mutations in HRR genes such as BRCA1/2, (2) methylation analysis of the BRCA1 promoter, (3) mutational signature profiling, and (4) composite genomic scar assays based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Among these, SNP-based HRD scoring has gained widespread clinical acceptance. It quantifies HRD as the sum of three structural features of genomic instability&#8212;loss of heterozygosity (LOH), large-scale state transitions (LST), and telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI)&#8212;derived from high-density SNP array or NGS data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This approach underpins the Myriad myChoice CDx test, which has been approved by the U.S. FDA as a companion diagnostic for PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer.</p><p id="Par9">However, applying uniform HRD score thresholds across different tumour types remains problematic. In ovarian cancer, the commonly used cutoff of &#8805;42 was established using BRCA-mutated cohorts and validated against treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In EC, where BRCA mutations are rare and HRD arises through more diverse and less-defined mechanisms, such a threshold may not accurately reflect clinically meaningful genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. More importantly, the lack of a validated surrogate or gold-standard comparator prevents the use of outcome-guided receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods to define optimal cutoffs.</p><p id="Par10">To address this limitation, unsupervised clustering based on the genomic distribution of LOH, LST, and TAI provides a data-driven approach to stratify patients. Unlike a fixed numerical threshold, clustering captures not only the total burden but also the chromosomal patterns of genomic scars, which may reflect distinct biological subtypes. This approach avoids arbitrary cutoffs and can be validated through associations with clinical, molecular, and immunologic features&#8212;offering a more flexible and biologically coherent classification framework, particularly in cancers like EC where HRD aetiology is heterogeneous and treatment paradigms remain under development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In parallel, we explored ROC curve analysis to identify optimal HRD score thresholds associated with survival outcomes; however, due to limited event rates, this approach did not yield a robust cutoff. Instead, we applied maximally selected rank statistics (maxstat) to define a prognostically relevant threshold. While clustering captures intrinsic genomic patterns and reflects underlying biology, maxstat-based cutoffs incorporate clinical outcome data to identify survival-associated inflection points. Together, these strategies provide complementary means of HRD stratification in EC. Standardisation of HRD assessment and prospective validation in clinical trials will be essential before widespread clinical adoption.</p><p id="Par11">In this study, we developed a comprehensive DNA-based testing strategy to integrate genomic scar-based HRD scoring with broader NGS profiling. Our approach simultaneously supports TCGA subtyping, mutation analysis of 520 cancer-related genes, and assessment of genomic instability through HRD score components. This multi-dimensional platform is designed to facilitate biologically informed molecular stratification and to provide actionable insights for prognosis and treatment guidance in EC. Specifically, we aimed to characterise the clinicopathologic, molecular, and immune features associated with HRD subtypes, assess their distribution across TCGA groups, and evaluate their potential utility in refining prognostic prediction and adjuvant treatment decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p id="Par12">This study included 142 patients who underwent surgical treatment for EC at Peking University Cancer Hospital between June 2011 and July 2020.

Harrell&#8217;s concordance index (C-index) was used to measure the discriminative ability of the molecular classifier model to predict the outcomes (DFS and OS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A C-index of 0.5 indicates that the model has no discriminative ability, and a C-index of 1 indicates that the model perfectly distinguishes between those who experienced an event and those who did not. For predicting recurrence, a support vector machine (SVM) model was developed using immune cell densities and HRD scores as input features. Model training and validation were performed using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation approach to ensure robustness. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC area under curve (AUC) as the primary metric, with an AUC of 1 indicating perfect predictive accuracy and 0.5 indicating no predictive ability. Hyperparameters were optimised to minimise bias and overfitting, and feature importance was assessed through recursive feature elimination to determine the relative contributions of individual predictors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p id="Par22">As illustrated in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, patients&#8217; age at diagnosis ranged from 30 to 78 (median 54) years old, with a median body mass index (BMI) of 25.66.

In the HRD-high group, genomic scars were present on nearly all chromosomes. In contrast, the HRD-middle group exhibited high-frequency genomic scars on specific chromosomes, such as chr1, chr2, and chr10, while the HRD-low group had almost no genomic scars. To further explore the prognostic relevance of HRD scores, we examined their distribution across the cohort and identified an optimal cutoff of 12 using maximally selected log-rank statistics (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1B</xref>).

Additionally, the DFS of patients with low-positive ratio CD8+PD-1+ T cells was significantly better than those with high-positive ratio CD8+PD-1+ T cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>HRD subtypes as predictive markers for treatment efficacy and recurrence risk</title><p id="Par34">Compared to the TCGA molecular classification, the HRD subtype provided superior prediction of DFS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). To address potential confounding, we performed multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, FIGO stage, BMI, LVSI, and depth of myometrial invasion. HRD subtype remained an independent prognostic factor for survival, with both HRD-Middle and HRD-Low subtypes showing significantly reduced hazard ratios compared to the HRD-High group (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.04 and 0.01, respectively; both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3A</xref>).

In clinical practice, patients classified as high or intermediate risk typically undergo adjuvant therapy.

HRD-High tumours were more frequently diagnosed at advanced stages and exhibited higher rates of deep myometrial invasion and LVSI, aligning with their elevated recurrence risk and poor survival outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Genomically, HRD-High tumours showed distinct mutational patterns&#8212;characterised by enrichment of TP53, RAD51, and SPOP mutations&#8212;and extensive chromosomal instability, including high SCIN and aneuploidy scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These tumours also demonstrated widespread genomic scars and a high prevalence of WGD, reflecting their elevated intratumoral heterogeneity and capacity to tolerate DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In contrast, HRD-Middle and HRD-Low tumours were more often associated with PI3K-AKT or Wnt pathway alterations, suggesting alternative oncogenic drivers and more stable genomic architectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These findings support HRD-High as a biologically distinct and clinically high-risk subgroup with implications for treatment resistance and recurrence.</p><p id="Par36">Beyond their association with aggressive biology, HRD subtypes also demonstrate meaningful divergence from existing molecular classification systems. When stratified by HRD subtypes, the HRD-high group demonstrated the worst prognosis, and the HRD-low group exhibited the best, indicating a strong association between HRD defects and tumour prognosis. Notably, the c-index evaluation suggested that HRD subtypes offer superior prognostic accuracy compared to the TCGA molecular classification. The data revealed that the HRD-low group, which includes a much larger sample size than the POLE group (75 vs. 10), contains 6 patients with TP53 mutations&#8212;patients who are typically associated with worse prognosis according to TCGA classification. Among the two groups with the poorest prognosis, the median OS for HRD-high patients was shorter than that of TP53-mutant patients. The c-index results also indicated that combining both classifiers could enhance the explanatory and predictive power regarding patient survival. HRD subtyping revealed additional prognostic information not captured by TCGA mutation-based groups. While HRD-High tumours overlapped with TP53-mutant cases and were absent among POLE-mutant tumours, HRD stratification further differentiated outcomes within TCGA-defined subtypes. For instance, multiple patients with serous carcinoma, FIGO stage III disease, and TP53 mutations received standard chemoradiotherapy. Among them, those with HRD-Low status (Patients 13 and 122) did not experience recurrence, whereas those classified as HRD-Middle or HRD-High (Patients 50 and 33) did. Similar patterns were observed among TP53-wildtype (Patients 132 and 66) and MSI-H tumours (Patients 16, 136, 49), where recurrence was more frequent in HRD-High cases despite otherwise comparable clinical features and treatment (Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These real-world cases exemplify the ability of HRD subtyping to further stratify risk within clinically and molecularly homogeneous groups, reinforcing its potential as a complementary biomarker.</p><p id="Par37">In addition to prognostic stratification, HRD status may influence tumour&#8211;immune interactions, which we further explored in this study. MSI-H and POLE-mutant patients exhibited significantly higher densities of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in both tumour and stromal regions compared to other subtypes, suggesting a higher immunogenicity and more active immune microenvironment in these groups, consistent with prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. High densities of CD3+, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages were associated with better DFS. Interestingly, the HRD-High group showed significantly higher levels of CD3+PD-1+ and CD8+PD-1+ T cells compared to the HRD-Middle and HRD-Low groups, indicating a dual immune phenotype characterised by T-cell recruitment and PD-1-mediated exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. HRD-driven genomic instability is known to increase tumour mutational burden and neoantigen generation, which may promote immune cell infiltration. However, this immunogenicity may be counterbalanced by immune evasion mechanisms such as PD-1 pathway upregulation, as reported in HR-deficient breast and ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. These findings suggest that HRD-High ECs may represent a subset of tumours with potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly when used in combination with DNA damage-targeted therapies. Supporting this hypothesis, early clinical trials have demonstrated the promising efficacy of combined PARP inhibitor and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 regimens in HRD-associated tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Although patients in our cohort did not receive immunotherapy, the presence of immune cell infiltration in HRD-High tumours highlights a tumour-intrinsic immune contexture that may be leveraged for future therapeutic strategies. CD8+PD-1+ T-cell enrichment, while associated with poor DFS in our study, may also serve as a biomarker for response to ICIs if immune evasion is pharmacologically reversed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These observations underscore the translational potential of integrating HRD scoring with immune profiling to inform personalised treatment in EC.</p><p id="Par38">Despite receiving standard adjuvant therapy, patients with HRD-High tumours experienced disproportionately high recurrence rates, suggesting a potential link between underlying genomic features and intrinsic resistance (Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Mechanistically, HRD-High tumours exhibited extensive chromosomal instability, complex structural rearrangements, and frequent WGD&#8212;genomic hallmarks that may drive tumour plasticity and therapy evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These alterations have been associated with impaired apoptotic signalling, replication stress tolerance, and subclonal diversification, enabling tumour cells to adapt under therapeutic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Moreover, while HRD scoring reflects homologous recombination dysfunction, not all HRD-High tumours harbour functional BRCA1/2 inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This distinction may explain the heterogeneous therapeutic responses observed in HRD-High ECs and points to the need for more precise functional assays to identify repair-deficient, treatment-responsive subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating HRD subtype analysis not only for prognostic stratification, but also to unravel resistance mechanisms and guide future trials evaluating DNA damage-targeted and combination strategies in EC.</p><p id="Par39">We developed a recurrence prediction model incorporating immune cell densities and HRD scores using an SVM framework. The model achieved an AUC of 0.733, indicating good predictive performance. These results suggest that integrating immune microenvironment features with HRD metrics may enhance recurrence risk stratification in EC.</p><p id="Par40">This study has several limitations. The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalisability of our findings. Maximally selected rank statistics were used to identify prognostic thresholds for HRD scores; In addition, the absence of patients receiving immunotherapy limits the applicability of our immune microenvironment findings. Prospective studies with larger cohorts and therapeutic intervention arms are needed to validate the predictive and therapeutic relevance of HRD subtyping in EC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">This study demonstrates that HRD subtyping based on genomic scar patterns provides prognostic and predictive insights beyond the conventional TCGA molecular framework in EC. HRD-High tumours exhibited aggressive clinical behaviour, genomic instability, and immunologically active but potentially exhausted microenvironments, suggesting both poor prognosis and candidate sensitivity to combined immunotherapy and PARP inhibition. Integrating HRD subtyping with TCGA classification significantly improved prognostic stratification and recurrence prediction. These findings support the clinical utility of incorporating HRD-based assessment into molecular diagnostics to optimise adjuvant treatment decisions and guide biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies in EC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
