Neuroendocrine carcinomas are associated with hereditary conditions such as Lynch syndrome; however, their co-occurrence with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is poorly documented. To date, only 1 patient of colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma in a patient with FAP has been reported. This report presents a patient with FAP. Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with lymph node metastasis was discovered during right colectomy. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments confirmed neuroendocrine differentiation with a high Ki-67 index (&gt;90%).

Adjuvant chemotherapy commenced postoperatively. No evidence of recurrence was observed for 18 months postoperatively. This case report highlights the rare presentation of colorectal large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in a patient with FAP, thereby contributing to the limited literature on this association. <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> mutations have been characterized in adenomatous polyposis and colorectal adenocarcinomas; however, their role in the pathogenesis of neuroendocrine carcinoma remains unclear.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms predominantly develops in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract; however, it can develop in nearly any organ.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> The World Health Organization classifies colonic neuroendocrine neoplasm as epithelial neoplasms with neuroendocrine differentiation that can be divided into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> The cells of the neuroendocrine neoplasms of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor retain the structural features of normal neuroendocrine cells for hormone synthesis and secretion. Neuroendocrine carcinoma are high-grade malignant neoplasms with cells that express little or no chromogranin A, somatostatin receptors, or hormones; however, high expression of INSM1 and synaptophysin has been observed in neuroendocrine carcinoma. Neuroendocrine carcinoma is poorly differentiated and high-grade by definition. Notably, it exhibits high proliferative activity and can be classified as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma based on the morphology.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> A high mitotic rate of &gt;20 per 10 high-power fields and a Ki-67 index of &gt;20% have been observed in neuroendocrine carcinoma. Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is smaller than three resting lymphocytes in &gt;90% of the tumor cells. The morphological features of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma include scanty cytoplasm, ill-defined borders, finely granular nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, nuclear molding, and a sheet-like or diffuse architecture. In contrast, large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma exhibits an organoid or diffuse growth pattern with frequent necrosis. The tumor cells are large with irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and distinct cell borders.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> Colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma, irrespective of the morphology, is exceedingly rare, accounting for only 1 to 2 patients per million annually,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> constituting approximately 0.6% of colorectal cancers.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup></p><p>Key genetic alterations drive the aggressive nature of neuroendocrine carcinoma. The most frequent mutations involve <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic>, which play crucial roles in tumor suppression and regulation of the cell cycle. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations, which are nearly ubiquitous in neuroendocrine carcinoma, result in a loss of genomic stability. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic> inactivation, which is particularly common in small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutations are frequently observed in gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. These mutations often co-occur with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations. Amplifications in the <italic toggle="yes">MYC</italic> family (<italic toggle="yes">MYC, MYCN</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MYCL</italic>) are other oncogenic drivers associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Mutations in the PIK3CA and PTEN pathways are occasionally observed in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoma. These mutations promote tumor growth and survival through aberrant PI3K/AKT signaling.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr7-10668969251346939" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

Computed tomography revealed the presence of a mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen near the cecum with possible perforation. In addition, enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the ileocolic, para-aortic, and gastrohepatic regions. Colonoscopy revealed a fungating, partially obstructed, circumferential mass in the cecum with &gt;100 colonic polyps. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy also revealed &gt;100 gastric polyps. Germline genetic test detected a heterozygous, pathogenic germline mutation in the <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> (C1270*), which indicated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Bowel rest, intravenous antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation were prescribed initially. However, the patient returned with fever and pain in the right lower quadrant following discharge and was diagnosed with an abdominal abscess. Presentation of fever and worsening abdominal led to the decision to perform an emergency right colectomy with diverting loop ileostomy to relieve obstruction.</p><p>Surgical resection revealed a circumferential tumor measuring 8.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4.5&#8197;cm extending from the cecum to the terminal ileum involving the appendix. The primary tumor, with a full-thickness perforation, was centered in the cecum (<xref rid="fig1-10668969251346939" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The tumor was located 8.0&#8197;cm and 14.0&#8197;cm from the proximal and distal margins, respectively, with abutting the radial and mesenteric margins. Numerous mucosal polyps (&gt;100) were observed in the remaining large bowel mucosa, consistent with the history of FAP.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1-10668969251346939" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Gross examination.

Immunostaining of the tumor cells revealed the following: strong and diffuse positivity for SATB2, INSM1, and synaptophysin immunostaining; patchy positivity for keratin AE1/3 (dot-like pattern), keratin CAM5.2, and keratin 20 immunostaining; and negative for CD45 (LCA), S100, SOX10, keratin 7, TTF1, CDX2, and chromogranin immunostaining, and mucicarmine special stain (<xref rid="fig3-10668969251346939" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The Ki67 index was &gt;90%. These features are consistent with those of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Additionally, the possible appendix was grossly identified and submitted entirely, however, it was completely obliterated and destroyed by tumor cells. The tumor was classified as a colonic primary tumor, given its location in the cecum. Metastatic carcinoma cells were detected in three of the 23 lymph nodes. Evaluation of the colonic polyps revealed that they were tubulovillous adenomas with focal high-grade dysplasia and multiple tubular adenomas, consistent with the history of FAP.

Thus, <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> gene alterations in patients with FAP may contribute to conventional adenomas and neuroendocrine differentiation within these lesions, thereby broadening the potential scope of impact of <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> on FAP-related neoplasia.

The tumor described in the present patient exhibited a distinct immunohistochemical profile. Furthermore, the tumor stained positively for INSM1, synaptophysin, SATB2, keratin 20, keratin AE1/3, and keratin CAM5.2 and negative for chromogranin, CDX2, and keratin 7. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. In contrast, the tumor described in the report by Detweiler et al exhibited mixed histological differentiation, including glandular and squamous components arising from an adenomatous polyp. The Ki-67 index was &gt;90% in both tumors, indicating the highly aggressive nature of both tumors. Extensive metastasis to the lymph nodes and liver at the time of diagnosis was reported by Detweiler et al, whereas only lymph node metastasis was observed in the present patient.
