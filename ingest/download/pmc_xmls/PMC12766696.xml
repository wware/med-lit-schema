These syndromes share several risk factors, including advancing age, lower education, ancestry, inflammation and other immune system dysregulation (<xref rid="R148" ref-type="bibr">Zab&#322;ocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Shade et al., 2024</xref>). Given these shared risk factors, AD and cancer would intuitively be positively associated with each other; however, numerous studies have reported a negative association, indicating lower incidences of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases among people with a cancer history relative to cancer-free controls (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Karanth et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R130" ref-type="bibr">Tirumalasetti et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Driver et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Mezencev and Chernoff, 2020</xref>). These observations raise questions about whether the inverse association is spurious or causal and, if it is causal, what underlying biological and environmental factors may explain it.</p><p id="P6">Genetic and transcriptomic studies investigated overlapping biological pathways in both cancer and AD (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Holohan et al., 2012</xref>). For example, microRNAs, including miR-9, miR-29, and miR-132, are important modulators of transcription, proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, DNA methylation, and tau pathology that are involved in AD (and other dementias) and cancer (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Holohan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R135" ref-type="bibr">Walgrave et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, p53, a tumor suppressor, undergoes aggregation, mislocalization, and interaction with tau oligomers in AD brains (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Farmer et al., 2025</xref>). The AD proteinopathic tau protein is normally involved in the stabilization of microtubules, and mutated tau (i.e., resulting from a mutation in the <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic> gene) is reported to influence the spread of cancer cells and cell growth (<xref rid="R136" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Mandelkow, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Blasco et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Although observational studies can provide valuable insights into associations, they are subject to various biases that limit the validity of causal inferences. Survival bias is a particular concern, as cancer patients may not live long enough to be at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD or Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD), or vice versa (<xref rid="R150" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Information bias is also problematic, as patients with dementia may not be accurately monitored for cancer or may have difficulty recalling their cancer history. Since the initial report by Tirumalasetti et al. in 1991 (<xref rid="R130" ref-type="bibr">Tirumalasetti et al., 1991</xref>), numerous studies have attempted to address these potential biases through improved study designs and statistical methods (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Driver et al., 2012</xref>). Mendelian randomization (MR) is an analytic approach used to estimate the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome when all factors (known and unknown) that may influence both cancer and neurodegenerative disease risk cannot be accounted for (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Burgess and Thompson, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The gold standard for inferring causality in epidemiological studies is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 1998</xref>). In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to treatment groups, and this randomization ensures that (on average) the groups are exchangeable (more formally, the probability of treatment provides no information about the probability of future outcomes) (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Hernan and Robins, 2023</xref>). However, conducting an RCT to examine associations between diseases such as AD and cancer is not feasible due to ethical and practical limitations. Instead, the MR approach, which exploits the random allocation of alleles from each parent to their offspring, is used to emulate randomization assignments in an RCT. Based on Mendel&#8217;s laws of inheritance, MR treats genetic variants as instrumental variables for exposures, effectively randomizing individuals by genotype, thereby leveraging the concept of the random allocation of alleles at conception to minimize confounding bias and reverse causation bias (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Davey Smith and Hemani, 2014</xref>). Recent improvements in imputation reference panels for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled MR to infer causal relationships with complex and polygenic diseases. Large-scale GWAS have identified many genetic variants linked to various diseases, facilitating MR studies that estimate causality when RCTs are not feasible.</p><p id="P9">MR plays an important role in observational studies, helping to elucidate causal relationships between AD and cancer, and identifying underlying therapeutic targets and candidates for drug repositioning for both diseases (<xref rid="R151" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="R105" ref-type="bibr">Pan and Jing, 2025</xref>; <xref rid="R141" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Two-sample MR, in particular, utilizes summary statistics from large-scale GWAS for each trait, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables, even for small effect sizes. In this review, we summarize recent two-sample MR (hereafter referred to as MR) studies to explore the causal relationships and potential biological connections between AD/PD and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><label>2.1.</label><title>Literature search</title><p id="P10">A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, with an open time frame (articles published up to 1 August 2024).

Notably, consistent inverse causal associations with AD were observed for colorectal, breast, endometrial, oral, lung, and prostate cancers, as well as leukemia, primarily supported by the IVW method. These results directionally align with previous observational studies reporting inverse relationships between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, MR analyses strengthen causal inference by minimizing confounding and reverse causation, suggesting that these associations are unlikely to be entirely attributable to survival or detection bias(es). Conversely, MR studies did not replicate the broad protective associations for all cancer types observed in epidemiological cohorts, implying that part of the inverse relationship may arise from shared biological aging mechanisms, immune regulation differences, or selective survival rather than direct causality. Overall, while observational studies suggested a generalized protective effect of cancer against AD and PD (or vice versa), MR findings delineate cancer-specific, modest causal effects and emphasize that the inverse association with AD is not universal but specific to certain cancer types. In contrast, evidence supporting a causal relationship between PD and cancer was limited and inconsistent. Given the high prevalence of CRC/breast cancer and their shared relevance with AD in aging populations, our discussion focuses on these two cancer sites.</p><sec id="S27"><label>4.1.</label><title>Biological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer</title><p id="P45">Neurodegenerative diseases and cancers have distinct underlying mechanisms.

However, primary IVW is biased when horizontal pleiotropic effects are introduced. Many studies apply other methods, such as MR-Egger, the weighted median approach, and model-based techniques to identify and adjust for horizontal pleiotropy, which may distort the findings (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Hemani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). The MR-Egger analysis relies on the Instrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect (InSIDE) assumption, which posits that the strength of genetic instruments (i.e., their associations with the exposure) is independent of any direct effects that they might have on the outcome (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Burgess and Thompson, 2017</xref>). This InSIDE assumption is often difficult to verify fully and may not always hold, making some methods less reliable in certain situations (<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). The weighted median- and mode-based estimations are also sensitive to outliers (<xref rid="R125" ref-type="bibr">Slob and Burgess, 2020</xref>). The weighted median method is imprecise when many instruments are valid, while the mode-based methods suffer from low precision power (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2019</xref>). Although MR-PRESSO can remove outliers, it may produce misleading results when many instrumental variables are invalid. Recent studies have employed MR-RAPS, which is robust to horizontal pleiotropy and less sensitive to weak instruments (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2019</xref>). Discrepancies between different MR approaches highlight the challenges of adequately addressing horizontal pleiotropy and invalid instruments. MR remains an emerging field, with new methods such as Contamination Mixture (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2020</xref>) and MR-Mix (pleiotropy robust) (<xref rid="R110" ref-type="bibr">Qi and Chatterjee, 2019</xref>), MR-cML (Constrained Maximum Likelihood) (<xref rid="R143" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2021</xref>), and CAUSE (Causal Analyses Using Summary Effect Estimates) (<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P67">Many of these methods offer advantages over earlier techniques. Experts recommend specific MR methods according to step-by-step guidelines, especially when addressing uncorrelated and correlated pleiotropy (<xref rid="R125" ref-type="bibr">Slob and Burgess, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the progress, each approach has strengths and limitations. When multiple MR methods produce consistent results within a study, the credibility of the causal inference is strengthened. However, discrepancies between methods do not necessarily invalidate causality; instead, they highlight the need for further investigation.</p><p id="P68">Furthermore, the use of GWAS summary statistics from populations of different races or ethnicities compared to target genetic data and the lack of sex-specific GWAS pose limitations to MR findings. Insufficient sample size reduces the statistical power necessary to detect causal relationships between diseases. Additionally, most MR studies do not explicitly account for survival bias or competing risks, which are particularly relevant for age-related diseases such as AD, PD, and cancer. These biases can affect genetic associations by selectively including individuals who have survived long enough to be studied, potentially distorting causal inference.</p><p id="P69">Another limitation in MR studies exploring the relationship between cancer, especially breast cancer, and AD is the risk of detection bias. Routine mammography screening typically ceases after age 70, and individuals with cognitive impairment are less likely to undergo cancer screening (<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">NHS, 2025</xref>; <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et al., 2010</xref>). These factors increase the likelihood of undiagnosed breast cancer in older or cognitively impaired populations, which may contribute to the observed inverse associations between the two diseases. Therefore, MR findings should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S32"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p id="P70">This review underscores that the relationship between AD/PD and cancer may be driven by cancer-specific mechanisms, particularly for breast cancers&#8212;where genetic findings align with observational data. This observation suggests that distinct biological pathways or interactions may underlie different neurodegenerative disorders and cancer types. A key limitation of current MR studies is that they do not account for shared biology. Methods like colocalization can help address this by determining whether the same genetic locus influences the exposure and outcome, especially since some SNPs may act as proxies through LD rather than exerting a direct effect. In addition to applying genome-wide significance thresholds, future MR studies investigating the relationships between AD/PD and cancers could adopt biologically informed strategies, such as selecting SNPs located within key cancer-related genes (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">TP53, RB1, BRCA1/2, PIN1</italic>) or relevant functional pathways. Using such targeted instruments may improve the biological interpretability of causal estimates and provide valuable insights into shared mechanisms linking cancer and neurodegeneration. As molecular profiling becomes routine in oncology, integrating known AD and neurodegenerative risk variants into clinical testing platforms could facilitate personalized cognitive risk stratification and survivorship planning. In the future, large GWAS that include diverse ancestry groups, sex-specific data, and integrated MR analyses&#8212;combined with colocalization and other functional approaches&#8212;will be crucial to improving causal inference. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of AD/PD and cancer relationships may ultimately inform survivorship care planning, guide cognitive screening strategies, and support personalized treatment decisions in elderly cancer patients at risk for neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="NIHMS2127907-supplement-1.xlsx" id="d67e1875" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P72">The authors would like to acknowledge the University of Kentucky Librarian Team for their guidance, resources, and support in conducting the literature search for this systematic review, and the College of Public Health Office of Scientific Writing for their assistance in manuscript preparation.</p><sec id="S35"><title>Funding</title><p id="P73">This study was supported by P01AG078116, P30AG072946 (University of Kentucky- Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) Development Project Program), and the Levis D. and Margot D.
