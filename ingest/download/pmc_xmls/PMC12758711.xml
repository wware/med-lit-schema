Characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, TNBC accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancer cases (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It disproportionately affects younger women and those with BRCA1 mutations (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and is associated with a high risk of early recurrence and distant metastasis (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The lack of hormone receptors and HER2 amplification limits the use of targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the mainstay of systemic treatment (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has become the standard of care for locally advanced TNBC, allowing tumor downstaging and enabling <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> assessment of chemosensitivity. Achieving a pathological complete response (pCR), defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes following NACT, is strongly associated with improved disease-free and overall survival (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, a substantial proportion of patients fail to achieve pCR, and these non-responders face a significantly higher risk of relapse and limited therapeutic options after standard treatment (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Given this variability in treatment response, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers capable of predicting which patients are more likely to benefit from NACT. Predictive biomarkers could enable personalized treatment approaches, in which likely non-responders are considered for alternative regimens such as immunotherapy or targeted agents (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), while predicted responders may be spared overtreatment and its associated toxicities.</p><p>Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have made it possible to investigate the transcriptomic landscape of TNBC in detail. This technology enables the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between responder and non-responder groups, offering insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, some DEGs may represent druggable targets, providing opportunities to improve therapeutic efficacy in chemoresistant cases (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Although several studies have explored gene expression profiles associated with pCR in TNBC, challenges such as limited cohort sizes and insufficient cross-cohort validation have hindered the generalizability of their findings (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Integrating publicly available datasets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provides an opportunity to enhance the robustness of candidate gene signatures through validation in larger and more diverse populations (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we analyzed RNA-seq data from TNBC patients treated with NACT at the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUH) and compared gene expression profiles with those from a chemotherapy-responsive TNBC cohort in TCGA. Our goal was to identify DEGs associated with pCR and validate their predictive value across independent datasets. We also evaluated the therapeutic potential of these genes using drug-gene interaction databases. Our findings may aid in the development of predictive biomarkers and targeted treatment strategies for TNBC patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Patient cohorts and sample collection</italic>.

However, survival comparisons should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited sample size.</p><p>For reference, the TCGA cohort consisted of 27 TNBC patients who demonstrated a favorable response to chemotherapy and showed no evidence of disease progression during follow-up. Due to differences in clinical annotations and dataset structure, statistical comparisons between the TCGA and KMUH cohorts were not performed.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Protein-coding DEGs identification.</italic> To further refine the list of potential biomarkers, we focused on identifying protein-coding DEGs that may have functional relevance and translational potential. By filtering RNA-seq data through protein-coding annotations, we aimed to prioritize genes most likely involved in the biological mechanisms underlying differential chemotherapy response. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A displays the normalized expression distributions of all 16 tumor samples, encompassing both pCR and non-pCR groups. The consistent distribution across samples suggests high-quality data and effective normalization, with no evidence of batch effects. Figure 2B shows the principal component analysis (PCA) of transcriptomic profiles, revealing a partial separation between pCR and non-pCR groups. Notably, non-pCR samples tend to cluster together, indicating shared transcriptional characteristics within this subgroup. Differential expression analysis (DEA) identified 175 DEGs between the two groups, including 146 genes up-regulated and 29 down-regulated in the non-pCR group (Figure 2C). DEGs were defined by an absolute log2 fold change &#8805;2 and a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt;0.05. Among these, 132 genes (104 up-regulated and 28 down-regulated) were annotated as protein-coding based on Ensembl. These protein-coding DEGs were further analyzed through unsupervised hierarchical clustering to assess their expression patterns across samples. As shown in Figure 2D, up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs formed clearly distinct clusters, indicating consistent intra-group expression and marked transcriptional differences between pCR and non-pCR tumors. These results support the potential of these genes as predictive biomarkers for treatment response in TNBC. To further investigate the functional implications of these DEGs, we performed GO enrichment and PPI analyses. The results are provided in Supplementary Figure S1, where Figures S1A-C present the top 10 enriched terms for molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, respectively. Figure S1D illustrates the STRING-based PPI network, highlighting protein-level functional relationships among the DEGs.

By integrating transcriptomic data from KMUH tumor samples and chemotherapy-responsive cases from TCGA, we discovered protein-coding DEGs that not only distinguish responders from non-responders but also exhibit strong cross-cohort reproducibility and therapeutic relevance.</p><p>Consistent with prior research highlighting pCR as a robust prognostic marker in TNBC (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), our findings support the utility of gene expression signatures for patient stratification prior to NACT. Notably, the 15 DEGs were significantly up-regulated in both KMUH pCR and TCGA responder groups, but down-regulated in KMUH non-pCR tumors. This expression pattern - confirmed through boxplots, heatmaps, and statistical analysis - reinforces the predictive value of the identified gene panel.</p><p>Among the DEGs, several genes such as <italic toggle="yes">CD74</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-DRB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PYCARD</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C1QA</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">HCST</italic> are involved in immune-related pathways such as antigen presentation, inflammasome signaling, and activation of lymphoid or myeloid cells (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CD74</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HLA-DRB1</italic>, for instance, are components of the MHC class II pathway that enhance tumor immunogenicity and promote T cell mediated cytotoxicity (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">PYCARD</italic> encodes ASC, a key adaptor in inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), while <italic toggle="yes">C1QA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HCST</italic> contribute to macrophage phagocytic activity and NK/T-cell signaling (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">IFI27L2</italic>, an interferon-stimulated gene, reflects activation of type I interferon pathways, which have been associated with improved responses to cytotoxic and immune-based therapies (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Other DEGs such as <italic toggle="yes">ASPHD2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SSR4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RPL27</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">FAU</italic> are involved in protein synthesis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, and cellular stress responses. SSR4, although underexplored in breast cancer, has been identified as a prognostic biomarker in colon adenocarcinoma and is associated with immune infiltration (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">RPL27</italic> has been implicated in chemotherapy sensitivity (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">FAU</italic>, typically considered a tumor suppressor, shows increased expression in pCR cases, possibly indicating enhanced apoptotic capacity (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">NDUFA4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CHCHD10</italic> are mitochondrial regulators of respiration and oxidative stress (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), while HSD17B8, a metabolism-related gene, is associated with better outcomes in breast cancer (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">OTOA</italic>, though not traditionally expressed in breast tissue, may represent a cancer-specific transcriptional aberration, and elevated expression of <italic toggle="yes">PSMB9</italic>, a component of the immunoproteasome, has been linked to favorable TNBC prognosis (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Together, these functionally diverse genes represent biological processes related to immune activation, metabolism, apoptosis, and stress responses, all of which may contribute synergistically to enhanced chemosensitivity. Integrated into a 15 gene signature, this panel demonstrated strong predictive performance for pCR in patients receiving standard NACT, including anthracyclines, taxanes, and platinum agents. Tumors with this expression profile may be more susceptible to cytotoxic damage, more capable of immune-mediated clearance, or less able to resist treatment, making this gene panel a promising tool for guiding clinical decisions and tailoring therapy.</p><p>Additionally, we found that DEGs such as <italic toggle="yes">HSD17B8</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RPL27</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">NDUFA4</italic> were enriched in metabolic and biosynthetic processes, including mitochondrial function and carboxylic acid metabolism. These findings suggest that chemoresistant tumors may exhibit distinct metabolic phenotypes, a hypothesis supported by literature on metabolic reprogramming in TNBC (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Importantly, DGI analysis identified four genes: <italic toggle="yes">CD74</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HLA-DRB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NDUFA4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PSMB9</italic> are potentially druggable. These genes interact with existing or investigational compounds, including proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, marizomib) and anti-CD74 monoclonal antibodies (milatuzumab). As visualized in the chord diagram, the therapeutic accessibility of these targets enhances the translational utility of the gene panel and suggests opportunities for repurposing agents in chemoresistant TNBC (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Study limitations.</italic> Several limitations warrant consideration. First, the KMUH cohort was relatively small (n=16), potentially affecting statistical power and generalizability. However, cross-validation with TCGA responders enhances the robustness of the findings. Second, TCGA lacked explicit pCR data, and response status was inferred from clinical outcomes, which may introduce classification bias. Third, while DGI analysis suggested potential therapeutic targets, functional validation through <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> or<italic toggle="yes"> in vivo</italic> experiments is necessary. Lastly, the interaction data were derived from curated databases and require experimental confirmation to establish clinical relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we identified a reproducible 15-gene expression signature predictive of pCR in TNBC.
