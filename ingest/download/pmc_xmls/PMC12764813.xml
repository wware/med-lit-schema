A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted between June and July 2023 across two medical universities in China. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to medical students to collect their demographic characteristics and KAP of cancer screening. A total of 520 valid questionnaires were collected, with 304 (58.46%) females and a mean age of 21.07&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.25 years. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 9.39&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.82 (possible range: 0&#8211;20), 31.4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.06 (possible range: 8&#8211;40), and 25.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7.04 (possible range: 8&#8211;40), respectively. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that knowledge directly influenced attitude (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;0.140, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003), attitude directly affected practice (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;0.145, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.002), and knowledge had a substantial and direct impact on practice impact on practice (&#946;&#8201;=&#8201;0.219, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). The study highlights inadequate knowledge, suboptimal attitude, and moderate practice towards cancer screening among medical students. The findings emphasize the need to enrich their knowledge through curriculum enhancements, foster positive attitudes via educational initiatives, and provide practical training opportunities.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-29124-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Knowledge, attitude and practice</kwd><kwd>Medical student</kwd><kwd>Cancer screening</kwd><kwd>Cross-sectional study</kwd><kwd>China</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Cancer genomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Huadong Medicine Joint Funds of the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. LHDMZ22H050001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Construction of Key Projects by Zhejiang Provincial Ministry</institution></funding-source><award-id>Project No.WKJ-ZJ-2302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Key Project of Scientific Research Foundation of Chinese Medicine</institution></funding-source><award-id>2022ZZ002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the &#8220;Pioneer&#8221; and &#8220;Leading Goose&#8221; R&amp;D Program of Zhejiang</institution></funding-source><award-id>2023C03075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Key project of Basic Scientific Research Operating Funds of Hangzhou Medical College</institution></funding-source><award-id>KYZD202002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>General Project of the Medical and Health of Zhejiang Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant Number 2021KY833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Cancer represents a significant global health challenge, with a staggering 19.3 million new cases and 10.0 million fatalities reported in 2020. This issue is particularly pronounced in China, where nearly 23.7% of new cases and 30.2% of the recorded deaths recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As a critical component of cancer control, cancer screening assumes a pivotal role in early detection, potentially saving lives by identifying cancers in their early stages or preventing their development altogether<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In China, cancer screening boasts a substantial history, spanning almost six decades, during which approximately two million high-risk individuals had undergone screening. This concerted effort resulted in the diagnosis of 55,000 cancer cases, achieving an impressive early detection rate of 80%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite these accomplishments, the quality of cancer screening in China has not yet met the desired standards, underscoring the necessity for ongoing enhancements in cancer screening practices and policies.</p><p id="Par4">The Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey serves as a diagnostic research tool, shedding light on a group&#8217;s understanding, beliefs, and actions regarding a specific topic, especially within the realm of health literacy. This tool is based on the premise that knowledge positively influences attitudes, which, in turn, shape behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Given that medical students are the future healthcare providers currently undergoing medical education, destined to become doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals directly involved in patient care and diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, their KAP have a significant impact on the promotion and implementation of cancer screening. Assessing the level of knowledge among medical students regarding cancer screening is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of medical education and determining the need to incorporate additional content related to cancer screening into the curriculum. Furthermore, understanding their attitudes and practices can reveal their viewpoints and behaviors concerning cancer screening, which is of paramount importance for future medical practice and patient care. If medical students exhibit a positive attitude and proactive practices in cancer screening, they are likely to play a more active role in advocating for early cancer detection and screening throughout their future careers. Moreover, while existing KAP studies on cancer screening are available, there is a noticeable gap in research that focuses on medical students&#8217; KAP regarding cancer screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the KAP of medical students towards cancer screening.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par5">This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and July 2023 at Zhejiang Chinese Medical University and Zunyi Medical College, and included medical students from both institutions.

Following the initial design, expert input was sought from two domain specialists to eliminate redundant or duplicative questions and to clarify any ambiguous statements. Prior to the official distribution, a preliminary pilot test was conducted among 39 participants, and the Cronbach&#8217;s &#945; coefficient was 0.881, indicating a good internal consistency.</p><p id="Par7">The finalized questionnaire encompassed the following dimensions: (1) Demographic characteristics, which included gender, age, residence, experience of internship (yes/no; as most students begin internships in later years, this variable partly reflects the period/year of study), professional category (Clinical: majors directly involving patient care; Non-clinical: majors not involving direct patient care). (2) Knowledge dimension, comprising 10 questions with a scoring system allocating 2 points for &#8220;well-known,&#8221; 1 point for &#8220;heard of,&#8221; and 0 points for &#8220;unclear&#8221;, with a possible range of 0&#8211;20. (3) Attitude dimension, composed of eight questions rated on a five-point Likert scale from &#8220;very positive&#8221; (5 points) to &#8220;very negative&#8221; (1 point), with a possible range of 8&#8211;40. (4) Practice dimension, consisting of eight questions similarly assessed on a five-point Likert scale ranging from &#8220;always&#8221; (5 points) to &#8220;never&#8221; (1 point), with a possible range of 8&#8211;40. Higher scores within each dimension indicated greater knowledge, more positive attitudes, and more proactive practices. Participants who scored above 80% of the total were categorized as having adequate knowledge, positive attitudes, and proactive practices. Those falling within the range of 60&#8211;80% of the total were classified as having moderate knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Scores below 60% of the total indicated inadequate knowledge, negative attitudes, and inactive practices.

This platform allowed for the creation of unique QR codes and accessible survey links. The research team collaborated with the academic administration and student affairs offices at Zhejiang Chinese Medical University and Zunyi Medical College. With their endorsement, the survey links and QR codes were shared with medical students through official university communication channels, including student online forums, departmental notice boards, and via student representatives during relevant academic sessions.</p><p id="Par9">A convenience sampling method was employed. Participants accessed the electronic questionnaire by scanning the QR code or clicking the shared link. To prevent duplicate submissions and maintain data integrity, the online survey platform was configured with restrictions, allowing each unique IP address to complete the survey only once. Following data collection, a rigorous quality control process was instituted to ensure the integrity and validity of the data. All questionnaire items were mandatory to guarantee completeness. Submitted questionnaires were reviewed for quality. Responses were classified as invalid and excluded if they showed signs of poor data quality, including refusal to participate, incomplete or missing crucial information, unusually brief completion times (e.g., less than 90&#160;s), logical inconsistencies, or discernible patterns of repetitive answers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par10">All data were processed and analyzed utilizing SPSS version 26.0 and AMOS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were described as mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard deviation (SD), while categorical variables are reported as frequency and percentage (n, %). For comparisons between two groups, t-tests were performed on normally distributed data; non-normally distributed data were analyzed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. For the analysis of three or more groups, ANOVA was employed for normally distributed data exhibiting equal variance, while Kruskal-Wallis tests were utilized in cases where these assumptions were not satisfied. Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation was applied to assess the relationships among knowledge, attitude, and practice scores, accommodating potential non-normality. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the measurement model, including the KMO test and multiple model fit indices (CMIN/DF, SRMR, RMSEA, IFI, TLI, and CFI). The structural equation modelling (SEM) was then conducted to analyze the interaction among knowledge, attitude, and practice, and each latent construct (KAP) was represented by its respective questionnaire items. To address concerns about the internal validity of the knowledge assessment and enhance our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. This involved recalculating the overall knowledge score and re-evaluating Spearman&#8217;s rank correlations among knowledge, attitude, and practice scores after excluding problematic items due to evidence updates, differences in clinical practice among countries, and terminologies (items 1, 6, 8, and 10).

These findings illuminate significant deficiencies in medical education that may hinder effective early cancer detection in clinical environments. They highlight the pressing necessity for curriculum enhancements aimed at better preparing future healthcare professionals with the requisite skills to promote proactive screening and enhance patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par25">Our analysis identifies knowledge gaps (Supplementary Table 2) that outline a roadmap for enhancing the curriculum. Deficiencies were observed in understanding screening protocols for colorectal, liver, and stomach cancers, including risk stratification, biomarker tests (such as FIT, AFP, and pepsinogen), and imaging techniques. This indicates that current medical education may not adequately convey the practical application of complex screening algorithms. Additionally, the ambiguity surrounding high-risk criteria for lung cancer (e.g., pack-year calculation) and the triage process for positive HPV tests in cervical screening highlights a disconnect in translating guidelines into actionable clinical knowledge. Targeted educational interventions are imperative to address these deficiencies. These interventions should include case-based learning, interactive risk calculation tools, and simulated patient counseling sessions. Such strategies can bridge the gap between guideline knowledge and the practical skills needed for advising patients in clinical practice. This focused approach ensures that educational resources are allocated to the most critical areas, potentially improving overall competency.</p><p id="Par26">While there are currently no established competency standards delineating the expected level of cancer screening knowledge for medical students, our findings can be contextualized by comparing them to analogous studies conducted in other countries, which have similarly identified knowledge gaps among medical students in this domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It is crucial to acknowledge that the knowledge level reported in this study was self-evaluated, which may influence the interpretation of the absolute scores. Comparable international studies have demonstrated insufficient knowledge among medical students regarding cancer screening, thereby reinforcing the consistency of our findings with global trends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Our assessment indicates that a considerable proportion of students possess an insufficient understanding of critical components related to cancer screening. This encompasses national guidelines for liver cancer screening, recommended methods for colorectal cancer screening, and the criteria for low-dose CT screening for lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the study identifies various factors that affect medical students&#8217; knowledge, attitudes, and practices, including their internship status, medical specialization, professional category, personal experiences with cancer screening, hospital volunteering, place of residence, and familial or social connections to cancer. These findings underscore the necessity for targeted interventions, such as specialized educational programs, to address these knowledge deficiencies and promote a more proactive and informed approach to cancer screening among future healthcare professionals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">It is essential to acknowledge that discrepancies between the questionnaire statements and contemporary literature may arise from advancements in clinical practice or variations in recommendations across diverse healthcare contexts, particularly between Chinese national guidelines and international standards. For instance, Questionnaire Item 6 concerning colorectal cancer screening advocates for the utilization of both colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for individuals aged 50&#8211;75 with low to moderate risk, and for those aged 40&#8211;75 at high risk. This recommendation is consistent with the 2020 Chinese guidelines, which endorse quantitative FIT as the primary screening modality, followed by colonoscopy for individuals with positive results, and suggest a colonoscopy every 5&#8211;10 years for high-risk populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, this combined approach is not universally adopted internationally; for example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT as standalone options for average-risk adults aged 45&#8211;75, without routine combination for all, to avoid over-screening and resource strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Similarly, Questionnaire Item 8 regarding breast cancer screening for high-risk individuals identifies criteria such as early menarche, late menopause, a history of benign breast disease, and breastfeeding duration, recommending the initiation of ultrasound or mammography at age 40. While this aligns with elements of the Chinese expert consensus that emphasizes risk-stratified screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, international guidelines, including those from the American Cancer Society (ACS), prioritize annual mammography beginning at age 45 for average-risk individuals and at age 40 for high-risk individuals&#8212;primarily defined by family history or genetic mutations such as BRCA1/2&#8212;with limited endorsement for ultrasound as an adjunct due to insufficient evidence regarding its independent efficacy in reducing mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These discrepancies highlight how evolving and region-specific guidelines can impact knowledge assessment, as our items were informed by earlier national standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which may not fully align with current international best practices. Nevertheless, our study underscores persistent gaps in guideline awareness among Chinese medical students, offering insights for curricular enhancements that could address these discrepancies and improve adherence in clinical settings, ultimately leading to improved early detection rates and reduced cancer morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Furthermore, students generally demonstrate a positive attitude toward cancer screening, acknowledging its significance for early detection and its role within clinical practice. However, a considerable proportion of respondents expressed apprehensions regarding the anxiety and fear that screening may provoke, indicating a need for balanced patient education and support. To optimize clinical practice, interventions should prioritize bridging knowledge gaps and addressing these concerns through comprehensive educational programs that integrate the latest evidence-based guidelines and effective patient communication strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">A key finding of the study is that, while medical students acknowledge the importance of cancer screening, a substantial proportion demonstrates only moderate engagement in practical application. This observation underscores a disparity between their comprehension of the significance of screening and their actual participation in screening initiatives, thereby indicating a need for enhancement. This gap can be attributed to inadequate practical experience and exposure to screening procedures within their educational framework. To mitigate this issue, medical curricula should integrate hands-on training and internships specifically focused on cancer screening, thereby equipping students with practical skills and fostering confidence in their ability to promote and engage in these initiatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Moreover, strategies should be employed to underscore the responsibility of medical professionals, including students, to actively participate in cancer screening as an integral component of their clinical duties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This approach is consistent with the perspective that, as future healthcare providers, medical students play a critical role in advancing early detection and mitigating cancer-related morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">This study reveals the complex relationships within the KAP framework, providing valuable insights into how these elements interact among medical students regarding cancer screening. The positive correlations observed between knowledge and practice, as well as between attitude and practice, highlight the importance of equipping medical students with comprehensive knowledge and fostering a positive attitude, as both factors significantly influence their participation in cancer screening initiatives. Interestingly, the lack of a significant correlation between knowledge and attitude suggests that these components are separate. This indicates that having knowledge does not automatically result in a positive attitude. Several factors could contribute to this unexpected finding, such as reliance on self-assessed knowledge instead of objective evaluations, differences in educational exposure among various subgroups, or unmeasured variables, like indirect experiences with cancer through family or community interactions, which may shape attitudes independently of knowledge levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Results from SEM further clarify these relationships, showing that knowledge directly influences both attitude and practice, while attitude acts as a mediator between knowledge and practice. This highlights the critical role of attitude as a link between knowledge and practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. It is important to note that the non-significant Spearman correlation between knowledge and attitude represents a zero-order association that does not account for other variables, whereas the SEM path coefficient reflects the direct effect of knowledge on attitude, considering its simultaneous relationships with practice. This distinction explains why SEM identified a statistically significant path from knowledge to attitude, despite the lack of significance in the simple correlation. From a clinical perspective, these findings suggest that targeted interventions aimed at enhancing knowledge could indirectly improve attitudes and practices, leading to more effective patient counseling on screening, higher adherence rates, and ultimately better cancer outcomes in underserved populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Overall, these results underscore the need for comprehensive educational interventions that not only increase medical students&#8217; knowledge but also foster a positive attitude toward cancer screening, thereby promoting proactive and informed clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, these outcomes emphasize that medical education should go beyond mere factual knowledge acquisition to include the development of a positive and proactive mindset. This highlights the necessity for well-rounded curricula that simultaneously address both knowledge and attitude components to drive improvements in clinical practice and patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">This study presents several limitations. Firstly, social desirability bias may have influenced participant responses, potentially creating a discrepancy between their true beliefs and behaviors and the reported data. Furthermore, the geographic and institutional focus on only two Chinese medical colleges constrains the generalizability of the findings to other medical schools in China or to international contexts. The voluntary nature of participation and convenience sampling may also introduce self-selection bias, and the lack of response rate prevents us from further assessing the extent of the bias. Meanwhile, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to examine longitudinal changes. Moreover, the knowledge assessment was grounded in national standards and expert consensus at the time of the study&#8217;s design. However, updates to guidelines, variations in clinical practice, and choice of terms may affect the accuracy of certain items, particularly Questions 1, 6, 8, and 10, which may not fully align with the international guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, this further limited the generalizability of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par33">In conclusion, medical students exhibited inadequate knowledge, suboptimal attitudes, and moderate practices regarding cancer screening. Based on the findings, there is a clear opportunity to advocate for a comprehensive strategy aimed at bolstering clinical practice among medical students in the field of cancer screening. This involves fortifying the educational curriculum to establish a strong knowledge base, cultivating a positive attitude through targeted educational initiatives emphasizing the importance of early detection, and seamlessly integrating practical training and workshops into the curriculum to hone vital clinical skills. Through the implementation of these measures, medical students can be better prepared to deliver holistic and effective care, leading to enhanced early cancer detection and improved patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
