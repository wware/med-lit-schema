Approximately 75% of OVCA cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the asymptomatic nature and the lack of effective early detection strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrates high initial response rates, the majority of patients with advanced-stage disease eventually develop disease recurrence accompanied by acquired platinum resistance. Clearly, new modalities of clinical management are needed for this deadly disease.</p><p id="Par6">Numerous studies have demonstrated that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) significantly prolong median progression-free survival in OVCA patients, particularly those harboring BRCA1/2 mutations or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The PARP family plays critical roles in repairing DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), among which PARP1 is the most extensively studied and therapeutically targeted member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. When PARP activity is inhibited via enzyme trapping by PARPi, unrepaired single-strand breaks (SSBs) persist, leading to replication fork collapse. These unresolved SSBs subsequently evolve into double-strand breaks (DSBs) at stalled replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These DSBs primarily depend on HR repair pathway for resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which involves BRCA2-mediated RAD51 filament formation to facilitate error-free strand invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, in BRCA2-deficient cells, unresolved DSBs cannot be efficiently repaired due to loss of HR-mediated repair. Consequently, persistent DNA damage accumulates beyond tolerable thresholds, ultimately inducing mitotic catastrophe and apoptotic cell death&#8212;the fundamental mechanism underlying PARP inhibitor synthetic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, BRCA2-deficient or mutant OVCA cells are particularly sensitive to platinum and PARP inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">While PARP inhibitors have significantly improved clinical outcomes for recurrent OVCA patients with BRCA1/2-mutation or HR deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], BRCA2-proficient tumors frequently exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance to PARPi, thereby compromising their efficacy in a substantial subset of patients. The molecular basis of PARPi resistance in BRCA2-proficient OVCA is multifaceted. BRCA2 plays a central role in HR by facilitating RAD51-mediated strand invasion during DSB repair. Tumors that retain functional BRCA2 can efficiently repair PARPi-induced DNA damage, thereby evading synthetic lethality. However, patients without HRD may not derive clinical benefit from PARPi therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This resistance underscores the necessity of developing combinatorial strategies to disrupt HRP and resensitize tumors to PARPi. One promising strategy involves transiently suppressing BRCA2 function to induce a &#8216;BRCA-deficient phenotype,&#8217; thereby restoring PARPi sensitivity in BRCA2-proficient OVCA. Nevertheless, achieving selective BRCA2 inhibition without inducing off-target toxicity or genomic instability remains a critical challenge requiring further investigation.</p><p id="Par8">Hyperthermia therapy (HT) is an effective anti-cancer treatment in which tumors are heated to 39&#8211;45 &#176;C by an exogenous energy source. It is usually used in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy to achieve greater efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Localized HT (41&#8211;43 &#176;C) enhances the efficacy of heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin or paclitaxel) in OVCA by increasing tumor drug penetration and synergizing with DNA damage. This approach is primarily indicated for OVCA patients with peritoneal metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Notably, previous studies have demonstrated that HT inhibits HR by targeting BRCA2 protein degradation in human cancer cells and tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. HT disrupts the BRCA2-RAD51 interaction via thermal denaturation of BRCA2&#8217;s DNA-binding domain, impairing RAD51 nucleofilament assembly at DNA damage sites. Furthermore, HT induces chromosomal aberrations and HRD through BRCA2 destabilization, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to PARP inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Based on these findings, HT could enhance the antitumor efficacy of PARP inhibitors in BRCA2-proficient OVCA models, both in vitro and in vivo. This antitumor effect is mediated by BRCA2 protein downregulation, which disrupts RAD51 nucleofilament assembly at DNA damage sites. The consequent HR deficiency leads to irreparable DNA double-strand breaks, replication stress-induced apoptosis, and subsequent tumor regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the present study, we found that HT could down-regulate BRCA2 protein levels and HR repair pathway in BRCA2-proficient OVCA cells. Our data demonstrate that HT treatment induces BRCA2-mediated HR impairment in OVCA cells, leading to accumulation of DNA DSBs and subsequent apoptosis. Consequently, the combination of HT with PARPi demonstrates a synergistic antitumor effect in OVCA cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and hyperthermia treatment</title><p id="Par10">The human ovarian cancer (OVCA) cell lines A2780 and OVCAR3, and the murine OVCA cell line ID8, were obtained from the Committee on Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CTCCCAS, Shanghai, China).

PARPi maintenance therapy has significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), particularly in HRD-positive patients, including those with BRCA1/2 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, approximately 50% of OVCA retain functional HR repair capacity (HR-proficient), resulting in primary PARPi resistance and consequently inferior clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. To overcome the limited efficacy of PARPi in HRP OVCA, extensive research has focused on identifying synthetic lethal partners for PARPi. Notably, Induction of HRD through combination therapies has emerged as a viable approach to sensitize HRP tumors to PARPi therapy. It has been demonstrated that combining PARPi with drugs inducing HRD&#8212;such as HSP90 inhibitors, vorinostat, and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)&#8212;can enhance tumor cell sensitivity to PARPi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Earlier studies have demonstrated that HT acts as a sensitizer for DNA-damage-based therapies. Specifically, combining HT with radiation or chemotherapy enhances their antitumor efficacy, as evidenced by significant effects in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Clinically, HT is primarily combined with conventional treatments (e.g., radiotherapy or chemotherapy) to potentiate their activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The underlying mechanism involves HT-mediated disruption of DNA repair pathways, which prevents damage resolution and amplifies the cytotoxicity of DNA-targeting agents. Consequently, this synergy improves therapeutic outcomes. Collectively, these findings establish HT as a potent DNA repair inhibitor in cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, several studies have reported that HT induces BRCA2 degradation, leading to impairment of BRCA2-mediated HR across multiple cancer types such as bladder, breast, cervical, HNSCC, and osteosarcoma. HT-induced degradation of BRCA2 causes mislocalization of RAD51, compromising HR-mediated DNA repair. Consequently, combining HT with PARPi synergistically enhances DNA damage accumulation and tumor cell death by simultaneously disrupting HR and base excision repair (BER) pathways. This combination strategy exploits synthetic lethality to selectively kill HR-deficient cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Our results suggest that hyperthermia impairs homologous recombination (HR) efficiency primarily by inducing BRCA2 degradation. Although basal RAD51 foci formation remains intact, this BRCA2 deficiency disrupts RAD51-mediated repair processes during DNA damage response. Although our data establish that moderate HT synergistically potentiates niraparib by disrupting BRCA2-dependent HR efficiency, the hierarchical relationship between BRCA2 proteolysis and other HT-induced molecular lesions in conferring PARPi sensitivity requires further delineation.</p><p id="Par37">WES analysis confirmed the absence of HT-induced mutations in BRCA2 or RAD51 genes, effectively excluding genomic alterations as a sensitization mechanism. The HT-induced reduction in BRCA2 protein levels likely creates a transient BRCA-deficient phenotype, forcing OVCA cells to depend on error-prone DNA repair pathways when challenged with PARPi-induced DNA damage. BRCA2 is essential for RAD51-mediated HR as it facilitates RAD51 nucleoprotein filament assembly on resected DNA ends through its conserved molecular chaperone activity. The observed therapeutic synergy between HT and niraparib indicates that BRCA2 reduction disrupts RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage foci, thereby incapacitating HR repair despite preserved RAD51 expression. Our findings reveal that HT exerts a dual mechanism of action by destabilizing BRCA2 protein and functionally impairing HR repair&#8212;a therapeutic strategy distinct from conventional HRD-targeted approaches in oncology. Critically, HT induces this BRCA2-deficient phenotype through non-genotoxic mechanisms, thereby avoiding the long-term risk of secondary malignancies associated with permanent BRCA2 loss-of-function mutations. These findings have important translational implications that localized or regional HT modalities [e.g., hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)] could be strategically combined with PARPi maintenance therapy. This supports clinical development of HT-chemotherapy-PARPi combination regimen for BRCA2-proficient OVCA patients, particularly those with peritoneal metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Future preclinical studies should systematically optimize HT parameters (temperature and duration) and therapeutic sequencing relative to PARPi administration, aiming to maximize tumor-selective synthetic lethality while maintaining normal tissue tolerability.</p><p id="Par38">In conclusion, HT synergizes with PARP inhibitors by inducing localized BRCA2-dependent HR deficiency, providing a rationale for PARP inhibitor-based combination therapy in BRCA2-proficient OVCA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
