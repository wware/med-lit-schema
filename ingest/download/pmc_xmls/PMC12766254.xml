MCM4 upregulation was similarly noted in the kidneys of mice with IRI-induced AKI (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>I-N). In vitro experiments corroborated our in vivo results, demonstrating increased MCM4 expression in cultured TECs following cisplatin and hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) treatments (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>O-R). Overall, our results demonstrate the substantial elevation of MCM4 in tubular cells after AKI stimulations, indicating its potential role during AKI development. However, as AKI developed, MCM4 expression was decreased in late stage (at day 4) of AKI, which might be attributed to the speed of TECs proliferation in different stages during AKI development (Additional file1: <xref rid="s0185" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>).<fig id="f0005" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The upregulation of MCM4 in AKI mouse models and cultured TECs.

However, the function and underlying mechanism of MCM4 in AKI remain unknown. In this study, we uncovered that MCM4 is significantly upregulated in renal tubules in AKI mouse models. Surprisingly, the upregulation of MCM4 in PTCs was adaptive during AKI development, as it mitigated tubular cells injury and promoted the regeneration of tubular cells. This response was observed in vivo in two unrelated AKI models using tubule-specific MCM4 knockout mice, as well as in cultured TECs treated with cisplatin. This protective function of MCM4 was further confirmed in cisplatin-treated AKI mice by overexpressing MCM4 in the kidneys via intrarenal AAV delivery. Moreover, we demonstrated the potential function of 53BP1 in AKI and uncovered that MCM4 mediates the expression of 53BP1 by regulating c-Jun activity, providing a new regulatory mechanism for the activation of p53/p21 signaling during AKI development.</p><p id="p0205">Previously, substantial studies reported that MCM4 exerted an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It has been reported that MCM4 expression and activity are regulated by the cell cycle, accumulating in the G1 phase, activating in the S phase, and degrading in the M phase, ensuring that replication occurs only at the appropriate stage <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, MCM4 deficiency was mainly induced the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Multi-omics analysis also indicated the enrichment in cell cycle of the interacting protein of MCM <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Besides, the phosphorylation of MCM4 also closely associated with DNA synthesis during DNA replication, resulted in a stagnation of cell cycle progression <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Moreover, the upregulation of MCM4 was often observed in a variety of carcinomas, which might relate to the malignant proliferation of tumor cells <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As a result, MCM4 has been identified as a potential novel proliferation marker <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, with more sensitivity than Ki67 and PCNA, providing clinical value and clinicopathological significance for predicting the occurrence and prognosis of tumors. In addition, the involvement of MCM4 in cell apoptosis also deserved attention. Overexpression of MCM4 markedly inhibited the ratio of cell apoptosis in tumor cells, with the improvement of proliferative ability, acting as a biomarker for prognosis <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. And the activation of MCM4 in DNA damage checkpoint also had an effect on apoptosis in HT29 cells <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As expected, our results also exhibited the similar changes that deficiency of MCM4 obviously inhibited the proliferative ability of TECs, accompanied with the G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These findings suggest that the functional role of MCM4 in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis is not limit to tumors cells, which may be applicable to all cells with proliferative capacity, just like TECs. However, there is few evidences exhibited the role of MCM4 in disease except for tumors. Therefore, this assumption needs further investigations.</p><p id="p0210">Research indicates that cell cycle arrest primarily triggers AKI onset and subsequent renal injury repair, with p53 being pivotal in cell cycle regulation <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. P21, a key downstream effector of p53, modulates cyclin-dependent kinase activity and is involved in cell cycle regulation <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. During AKI, where kidney cells are damaged by ischemia, hypoxia, or exposure to toxins, p53 prevents the replication of damaged DNA and the transmission of genetic errors by blocking the cell cycle <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. And p53-induced apoptosis helps to clear cells beyond repair, but excessive apoptosis may lead to further deterioration of kidney function <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In addition, during AKI recovery, the level and activity of p53 are declined, allowing surviving cells to re-enter the cell cycle and promote tissue repair and regeneration <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. That is to say, p53 clears damaged cells by blocking cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in the early stage of AKI, while the decreased activity of p53 promotes cell proliferation and tissue repair during the recovery period of AKI <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This dynamic balance of p53 activity is critical to the progression and recovery of AKI. Based on these researches, we hypothesized whether p53 was involved in MCM4-induced AKI by regulation cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis, and we also aimed to identify novel targets that modulate p53 pathway in AKI. Gene enrichment analysis identified MCM4&#8242;s role in regulating DNA replication, the cell cycle, the p53 pathway, and Notch signaling <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis of the gain-of-function p53 mutant revealed elevated MCM4 protein levels, despite unchanged MCM4 transcript quantities <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. A recent study identified 415 genes were regulated by the p53-p21-RB signaling pathway, one of them being MCM4 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In our study, we found that MCM4 negatively modulates the p53/p21 pathway. Inhibition of p53 activity partially reversed the effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in MCM4-deficient cells, offering direct evidence that MCM4 could be a novel target in regulating the p53/p21 pathway. However, the relationship between p53 and MCM4 is complex, and their specific regulatory mechanisms require further investigation.</p><p id="p0215">The p53-interacting protein, 53BP1, is essential for the functional effects of p53 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recently, studies have identified 53BP1 as a key component in the p53 pathway, influencing p53-dependent gene activation and cell fate determination <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The 53BP1-USP28-p53 pathway plays a role in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease by regulating centrosomal integrity and the mitotic surveillance mechanism <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Besides polycystic kidney disease, 53BP1 has been implicated in hemodialysis and transplantation <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>; however, studies on the function of 53BP1 in the development of AKI are limited. In our study, we firstly found the upregulation of 53BP1 in AKI mouse models and cisplatin-treated TECs. And we further declared the correlation between 53BP1 and p53/p21 signaling in the functional role of MCM4. Although significant c-jun-binding activity was identified in the 53BP1 promoter and MCM4 regulates c-jun activity, further research is required to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms.</p><p id="p0220">MAD2B has been identified as a crucial regulator of cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle, parietal epithelial, and glomerular endothelial cells <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Recently, we observed upregulation of MAD2B in cisplatin-induced AKI, and that the tubule-specific loss of MAD2B aggravated the severity of kidney injury by enhancing p53 signaling, indicating an adaptive response of MAD2B in PTCs during AKI. In our study, we also found a similar adaptative phenomenon, in which MCM4 was increased during AKI development, where it played a renoprotective role. Therefore, we hypothesized a connection between MAD2B and MCM4 during AKI development. As anticipated, MAD2B mediated the activity of CDK4/Cyclin D1 complex, then affected the phosphorylation level of Rb and the expression of E2F1, ultimately regulated the transcription of MCM4.</p><p id="p0225">The MCM4/6/7 complex, part of the MCM2-7 complexes, acts as a replicative helicase and controls DNA replication <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Mutations in MCM4 disrupt the integrity of the MCM4/6/7 complex, leading to the dissociation into trimeric complexes and affecting the subsequent interactions of trimers <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. MCM4 mutations disrupt its interaction with MCM6, destabilizing the MCM2-7 complex, which leads to deregulated DNA replication and abnormal chromosome structures <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. And the disorder of DNA replication caused by MCM4 mutation might be associated with the disordered progression of the S phase <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In our study, MCM4 deficiency resulted in the inhibition of G1/S transition and DNA synthesis, potentially affecting the proliferative ability of tubular cells. In addition, MCM4 knockdown decreased the levels of MCM6 and MCM7 (Additional file1: <xref rid="s0185" ref-type="sec">Fig. S5</xref>), indicating that MCM4 deficiency disturbs the stability of MCM4/6/7 complex, impacting DNA helicase activity. Our prior research indicated that MCM6 depletion reduced MCM4 and MCM7 levels, underscoring the critical role of MCM4/6/7 complex stability <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. These results may explain the effect of the loss of MCM4 on the inhibition of TECs proliferation, which may be attributed to the instability of MCM2-7 complex and thereby retarding DNA replication.</p><p id="p0230">Recently, the role of MCM4 in kidney injury and repair has not been fully understood, but may be related to cell proliferation and DNA repair. After kidney injury, TECs need to proliferate to replace the damaged tissue in order to repair. MCM4, as a key factor in DNA replication, may support this process by promoting cell proliferation. In addition, kidney damage is often accompanied by DNA damage. MCM4 may help cells restore genomic stability by participating in DNA repair mechanisms. On the other hand, MCM4 may collaborate with other repair proteins to repair damaged DNA and prevent cell apoptosis or cancer. In our studies, the high expression of MCM4 accelerated the cell cycle progression and promoted the proliferation of TECs, indicating an important role of MCM4 during AKI development. In AKI-post renal repair progression, MCM4 may accelerate the recovery from injury by promoting the regeneration of TECs and replacing the injured cells, as well as the involvement of cell cycle regulation. Moreover, excessive proliferation may lead to fibrosis, and regulating MCM4 may help inhibit this process. At present, the functional role of MCM4 in AKI-post kidney repair is being studied by our research group. And the specific mechanisms of MCM4 in kidney injury and repair needs further investigation. Future studies can further explore the role of MCM4 in other kidney diseases.</p><p id="p0235">In addition, it is currently unclear whether 53BP1 upregulation, induced by cisplatin administration, is causatively linked to worsening of AKI. The relationship between 53BP1 and p53 protein levels in AKI-induced renal injury is not yet understood. Investigating whether 53BP depletion induces p53 protein degradation is crucial, as 53BP1 silencing in renal cells results in reduced p53 protein expression. Therefore, it would be inspiring to explore the functional role of 53BP1 and its interaction with p53 during AKI development in future studies. Moreover, despite of careful inquiry, the specific role and underlying mechanism of MCM4 in the regulation of 53BP1 expression is poorly understood. Future proteomic studies of MCM4 and 53BP1 proteins might help solve this problem. Besides, no specific therapeutic strategy targeting MCM4 is currently undergoing clinical trials, and the clinical value and efficiency targeting MCM4 in the treatment of patients with AKI remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0240">In conclusion, our study firstly provides direct evidence that MCM4 plays an adaptive and renoprotective role in PTCs in AKI, preserving the proliferative ability of injured PTCs and limiting their apoptosis, thereby mitigating the severity of AKI development. Additionally, we have uncovered that the 53BP1-p53-p21 axis, mediated by MCM4, is an instrumental mechanism responsible for AKI development, which is a novel regulatory pathway. And the reno-protective role of MCM4 is partial mediated by MAD2B in the progression of AKI. Additional studies are required to clarify the regulatory mechanisms and investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting MCM4 and its related pathways in managing AKI.</p></sec><sec
