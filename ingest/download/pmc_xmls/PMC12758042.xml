These mutations greatly increase cancer risks, highlighting the critical need for more effective screening and prevention strategies. This review aimed to summarize existing evidence and propose a comprehensive approach to reducing cancer risk in unaffected mutation carriers. A narrative review of published literature was conducted to evaluate risk-reduction strategies, including surveillance, enhanced imaging, risk-reducing surgeries, and chemoprevention. Barriers to the uptake of these strategies and the psychological impact on carriers were also examined. Annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the most sensitive screening tool for early breast cancer detection in high-risk individuals. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors have shown potential as chemopreventive agents, but uptake remains limited due to concerns about efficacy and side effects. Risk-reducing surgeries, such as bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) and mastectomy, significantly lower the risk of breast and ovarian cancer; however, their uptake is often hindered by emotional, cultural, and financial factors. Family communication of genetic results and support by healthcare professionals are critical to encouraging preventive actions. Effective screening and risk-reduction strategies are available for <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> carriers, yet barriers to implementation persist. Personalized counseling, enhanced accessibility, and culturally sensitive education are essential to improving the adoption of these preventive measures.

In 2024, approximately 311,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 56,500 cases of ductal carcinoma <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> (DCIS) will be diagnosed among US women, and 42,250 women will die from breast cancer, highlighting the importance of effective and more accessible breast cancer screening and risk-reduction strategies [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Lifetime risk for breast cancer varies across countries due to differences in population structure, screening practices, and access to healthcare systems. In the United States, it is estimated that one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over the past decade, knowledge and experience have helped identify a subgroup of women at higher risk than others. Age, reproductive background, and a family history of breast and ovarian cancer are recognized contributors to risk. Additionally, prior breast biopsies, especially those with findings like atypical hyperplasia (AH), or lobular carcinoma <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> (LCIS) are established risk factors.</p><p>Risk-reducing strategies to lessen the burden of breast cancer in society are highly needed but may be difficult to implement; some of the risk factors are non-modifiable and many of the modifiable risk factors require greater efforts at both individual and society levels.</p><p>Effective breast cancer risk-reduction strategies including chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery are significantly undervalued and underutilized [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies utilizing selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including tamoxifen and raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as exemestane and anastrozole, have shown significant efficacy in lowering the risk of first breast cancer among high-risk individuals [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, false sense of well-being and potential harm associated with the use of these medications resulted in low uptake of these strategies among high-risk women.</p><p>Hereditary breast cancer contributes to approximately 10-15% of all breast cancers, another similar or even higher proportion of cases associated with positive family history but with no identifiable cancer-predisposing genetic variants [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The clinical criteria for germline genetic testing have been recently expanded by many international professional societies to probably include over 80% of all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

At-risk family members should also be offered the testing following extensive counseling. The decision to pursue genetic screening often depends on the patient&#8217;s awareness and level of information regarding genetic risks. Currently, awareness and understanding of genetic testing vary, as many patients may not be fully informed about their options unless prompted by their healthcare provider. Genetic counseling sessions and consultations with oncologists, geneticists, or primary care physicians are key opportunities for patients to learn about these possibilities. However, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests are becoming accessible and affordable, often being conducted without the necessary pre- or post-test counseling, as will be further explored below.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Family Cascade Testing</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Direct invite of family members</title><p>Discussing serious health issues within families is often complex, and this complexity increases when the condition is cancer, especially if it is inherited [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

However, almost half of them (n = 286, 44.5%) had taken no action. Cited reasons for not undergoing genetic testing by at-risk family members included fear of receiving positive test results (54%), cost of testing (50%), unwillingness to undergo preventive measures (34%), and social stigma (15%) [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>A study conducted in the United States surveyed 1,103 women who had BRCA testing regarding how they shared their results with relatives; 97% indicated they had informed at least one family member.

Current clinical guidelines recommend that testing should be offered to a subset of breast cancer patients, as it may inform treatment decisions and risk management for both patients and their close relatives. However, The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends genetic testing for all patients with breast cancer, regardless of their risk factors [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, extending these recommendations to all women, irrespective of their breast cancer status, is not universally endorsed. Recent studies from the USA [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Canada [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] assessing population-wide multigene testing for breast cancer prevention concluded that this strategy could be more cost-effective than testing based on family history, particularly among women aged 30 - 35 years. Despite these findings, there is no consensus that all women should undergo genetic testing. The decision to implement population-based genetic testing must consider factors such as the potential psychological impact of testing, the frequency of pathogenic variants in the general population, and the ability of the healthcare system to offer adequate genetic counseling and follow-up care, including risk-reducing strategies [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Age to start routine annual MRI screening for BRCA1/2-positive women depends on personal and family history of breast or other cancers and age at first breast cancer diagnosis in the family [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Starting at age 40, MRI screening can be supplemented by mammography and optionally breast ultrasound, which can be done alternating at 6-month intervals [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Though several studies have demonstrated a lower rate of interval breast cancer among screened patients, no direct reduction in cancer mortality was observed utilizing high-risk MRI-based surveillance program [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

A VUS may be found in a gene known to be associated with a disease, but there is insufficient evidence to confirm whether the specific variant causes or contributes to the disease. The classification of VUS is a crucial part of genetic testing and interpretation. The criteria for VUS classification are usually based on guidelines set by professional bodies and usually depend on the frequency of the detected variant in the general population in public database like the ClinVar, variant&#8217;s location within the gene, functional studies, family segregation studies, and scientific literature reports.

It is important to keep patients informed about the reclassification status of their variants and they should be empowered to make decisions about their healthcare based on the most current information.

It is hoped that ongoing and future research on chemoprevention will help ease at least some of the growing concerns of patients and their at-risk family members. New molecular technologies, like liquid biopsies, may be useful in future research to help detect breast, ovarian, and other cancers at a much earlier stage among carriers of cancer-predisposing genes.
