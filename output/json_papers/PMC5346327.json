  "title": "A role for PGC1-alpha in nucleus accumbens neuron subtypes in cocaine action",
  "abstract": "Molecules critically involved in cocaine behavioral plasticity are known to regulate and interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha, PGC-1α. Additionally, the PGC-1α promoter has binding sites for early growth response 3 (Egr3), which plays a dynamic role in cocaine action in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor D1 vs. D2. However, the role of PGC-1α in NAc in cocaine action is unknown. PGC-1α mRNA and protein were examined in NAc after repeated cocaine exposure. Binding of Egr3 to and histone methylation at the PGC-1α promoter was examined in NAc, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), after repeated cocaine. PGC-1α ribosome-associated mRNA in MSN subtypes was assessed after repeated cocaine using D1-Cre-RiboTag and D2-Cre-RiboTag lines. Finally, PGC-1α was expressed in NAc D1-MSNs vs. D2-MSNs using a Cre-inducible AAV and Cre lines during cocaine conditioned place preference and cocaine-induced locomotion. Repeated cocaine increased PGC-1α levels, and increased Egr3 binding and H3K4me3 at the PGC-1α promoter in NAc. Increased PGC-1α occurred in D1-MSNs, while D2-MSNs showed reduced levels. Viral mediated expression of PGC-1α in D1-MSNs enhanced behavioral responses to cocaine, while expression in D2-MSNs blunted these behaviors. We demonstrate a novel role for PGC-1α in NAc in cocaine action. PGC-1α is enhanced in NAc D1-MSNs specifically after cocaine exposure. These data are consistent with increased active methylation and Egr3 binding at the PGC-1α promoter. Finally, we demonstrate a bidirectional role for PGC-1α in mediating behavioral plasticity to cocaine through D1-MSNs vs. D2-MSNs.",
