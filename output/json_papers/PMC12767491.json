  "title": "Research progress on glycolytic reprogramming in ophthalmic diseases",
  "abstract": "The retina is one of the most energy-demanding tissues in the human body. Retinal energy metabolism is primarily dominated by aerobic glycolysis, with more than 80% of the glucose consumed being converted to lactic acid. As a highly energy-consuming tissue, the metabolic characteristics of the retina, especially aerobic glycolysis, are essential for maintaining retinal cell function during normal physiological processes. However, in disease states, this metabolic balance is disrupted, leading to a range of pathological changes. There is currently growing evidence that metabolic reprogramming is a pathological cause of diseases such as retinal degeneration, uveal melanoma, and glaucoma. This article reviews the mechanisms involved in metabolic reprogramming in ocular diseases and describes relevant therapeutic targets. Despite the many advances, the regulatory mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in ophthalmic diseases still need to be thoroughly investigated, and new therapeutic strategies are expected to be developed based on this in the future.",
