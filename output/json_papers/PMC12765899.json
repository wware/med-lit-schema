  "title": "Mitophagy in the pathogenesis and management of disease",
  "abstract": "Mitophagy, an evolutionarily conserved quality-control process, selectively removes damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular machinery underlying mitophagy — from receptors and stress-responsive triggers to lysosomal degradation — illustrate its key role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and adapting mitochondrial function to ever-changing physiological demands. In this review, we outline the fundamental mechanisms of mitophagy and discuss how dysregulation of this pathway disrupts mitochondrial function and metabolic balance, driving a wide range of disorders, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune-related diseases, as well as cancer. We explore the dual role of mitophagy as both a disease driver and a therapeutic target, highlighting the efforts and challenges of translating mechanistic insights into precision therapies. Targeting mitophagy to restore mitochondrial homeostasis may be at the center of a large range of translational opportunities for improving human health.",
