  "title": "Gene-Expression Profiling to Decipher Breast Cancer Inter- and Intratumor Heterogeneity",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer is heterogeneous and differs substantially across different tumors (intertumor heterogeneity) and even within an individual tumor (intratumor heterogeneity). Gene-expression profiling has considerably impacted our understanding of breast cancer biology. Four main “intrinsic subtypes” of breast cancer (i.e., luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like) have been consistently identified by gene expression, showing significant prognostic and predictive value in multiple clinical scenarios. Thanks to the molecular profiling of breast tumors, breast cancer is a paradigm of treatment personalization. Several standardized prognostic gene-expression assays are presently being used in the clinic to guide treatment decisions. Moreover, the development of single-cell-level resolution molecular profiling has allowed us to appreciate that breast cancer is also heterogeneous within a single tumor. There is an evident functional heterogeneity within the neoplastic and tumor microenvironment cells. Finally, emerging insights from these studies suggest a substantial cellular organization of neoplastic and tumor microenvironment cells, thus defining breast cancer ecosystems and highlighting the importance of spatial localizations.",
