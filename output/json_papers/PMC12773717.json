  "title": "CHAMP1 complex promotes heterochromatin assembly and reduces replication stress",
  "abstract": "Replication stress (RS) is a major driver of genome instability in cancer. We discovered that the CHAMP1 complex, a set of proteins that assembles heterochromatin, plays a critical role in relieving RS. By depositing repressive histone marks, the complex stabilizes replication forks and prevents their degradation. Disruption of CHAMP1 complex creates unique vulnerabilities in cancer cells, including those cells with the (ALT) mechanism of telomere maintenance or with CCNE1 amplification. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which heterochromatin structure can safeguard DNA replication and highlight CHAMP1 as a potential therapeutic target for tumors with high levels of RS.",
