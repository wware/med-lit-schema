  "title": "Fusobacterium nucleatum Contributes to the Carcinogenesis of Colorectal Cancer by Inducing Inflammation and Suppressing Host Immunity",
  "abstract": "The presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in the gut is associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). F. nucleatum promotes tumor development by inducing inflammation and host immune response in the CRC microenvironment. Adhesion to the intestinal epithelium by the cell surface proteins FadA, Fap2 and RadD expressed by F. nucleatum can cause the host to produce inflammatory factors and recruit inflammatory cells, creating an environment which favors tumor growth. Furthermore, F. nucleatum can induce immune suppression of gut mucosa by suppressing the function of immune cells such as macrophages, T cells and natural killer cells, contributing the progression of CRC.",
