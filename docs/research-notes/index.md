# Research Notes

This section captures **working thoughts**, design decisions, and experiments. It's the "why" behind architectural choices - useful for understanding the project's evolution and future direction.

- [Epistemology & Design](epistemology.md) - Deep insights on graph layering, edge types, and query semantics
- [Next Steps](next-steps.md) - Current priorities and roadmap

## Why keep research notes?

Most documentation answers "what" and "how". Research notes answer "why" and "what if".

These notes capture:

- **Design insights** that informed architectural decisions
- **Experiments** and their outcomes
- **Strategic thinking** about project direction
- **Conversations** with AI assistants that yielded valuable ideas

They're not polished documentation - they're working documents that preserve context future contributors (including future-you) will need.
