# JSON-based query language

Our storage stuff is agnostic across

* SQLite with sqlite-vec
* PostgreSQL with pgvector
* Neo4J

It would be nice to have a storage-agnostic query language that
works with all of these. I had some notes that were pertinent to
such a query language.

See NOTES.md for my thoughts, that's what I can put my hands on quickly,
I might be able to come up with more later.
